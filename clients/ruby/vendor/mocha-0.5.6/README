= Mocha

Mocha is a library for mocking and stubbing using a syntax like that of JMock[http://www.jmock.org], and SchMock[http://rubyforge.org/projects/schmock]. Most commonly Mocha is used in conjunction with Test::Unit[http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Test/Unit.html], but it can be used in other contexts.

One of its main advantages is that it allows you to mock and stub methods on _real_ (non-mock) classes and instances. You can for example stub ActiveRecord[http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html] instance methods like +create+, +save+, +destroy+ and even class methods like +find+ to avoid hitting the database in unit tests.

Mocha provides a unified, simple and readable syntax for both traditional mocking and for mocking with _real_ objects.

Mocha has been harvested from projects at Reevoo[http://www.reevoo.com] by me (James[http://blog.floehopper.org]) and my colleagues Ben[http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths], Chris[http://blog.seagul.co.uk] and Paul[http://po-ru.com]. Mocha is in use on real-world Rails[http://www.rubyonrails.org] projects.
