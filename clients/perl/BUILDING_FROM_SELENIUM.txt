This module's WWW/Selenium.pm is generated from iedoc.xml, an artifact of the
Selenium-core build.  Because the file is generated, it is not kept in
subversion.  To create this file, follow these steps:

1) Find a iedoc.xml, and put it in the perl/ directory.
   To download and extract iedoc.xml from the latest nightly selenium-core
   build, run:
   
     perl util/fetch_iedoc_xml.pl

2) Generate lib/WWW/Selenium.pm and t/selenium-core.t from iedoc.xml:

     perl util/create_www_selenium.pl

3) Profit!
