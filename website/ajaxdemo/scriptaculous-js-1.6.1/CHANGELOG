* Sortable trees [thx Sammi Williams, sammi@oriontransfer.co.nz]
  - Added functional test (test/functional/sortable_tree_test.html)
  - removed greedy option
  - modified the way Droppables.show works - added affected list
  - added Droppables.findDeepestChild
  - modified Sortable.options to work for trees
  - modified Sortable.onEmptyHover with additional logic to insert
    the element at a certain place according to the overlap
  - modified Sortable.onHover to avoid DOM Exceptions
  - modified Sortable.create to support the creation of Sortable trees
  - added two convenience functions - Sortable.findElements and 
    Sortable.findTreeElements
  - Added Sortable.tree (and a number of private functions to facilitate it)
    Returns a tree structure:
      var root = {
        id: null,
        parent: null,
        children: <children>,
        container: <sortable element>,
      }
      var child = {
        parent: <node>,
        children: <array>,
        id: <string> (as per options.format),
        element: <element>,
        container: <element>,
        position: <integer>
      }
    This is intended to become part of the public API, and can be used to manipulate
    the tree programatically.
  - Modified Sortable.serialize to use Sortable.tree when set in the options.
