  iPhone Simulator 
  ----------------

  The iPhone Simulator is a simple command line utility for 
  launching an iphone application in the simulator. This allows
  for nice things like automated testing of unit tests, etc without
  having to open XCode.

  The original code was written by Landon Fuller (with license
  below).  Minor modifications made by Jeff Haynie (Appcelerator).


  You can run the application by first building your application in
  xcode using the xcodebuild command from the command line.  You can
  then run it in the simulator using the following as an example:

  ./iphonesim launch ~/tmp/yourproject/build/Debug.simulator/yourproject.app

  You need to point to either Debug.simulator or Release.simulator based 
  on which build type you built with.


  Cheers!
