 * registers his SpecificHttpClient as the default HttpClient, then his
 * functions will be called by the user of an HttpClient, such as an
 * OCSPChecker.
 *
 * The implementer of a specific HttpClient (e.g., the NSS-provided
 * DefaultHttpClient), populates an SEC_HttpClientFcnStruct, uses it to
 * register his client, and waits for his functions to be called.
 *
 * For future expandability, the SEC_HttpClientFcnStruct is defined as a
 * union, with the version field acting as a selector. The proposed
 * initial version of the structure is given following the definition
 * of the union. The HttpClientState structure is implementation-

 * to the caller.

 * the function will return SECSuccess and set http_response_data_len to
 * the size of the block returned in http_response_data.

 * size, the function will return SECFailure.

 * accpeptable size, but the real size is not yet known to the http client 
 * implementation and it stopped retrieving it,
 * Any other out value combined with a return value of SECFailure
 * will indicate the actual size of the server data.
 *
 * The caller is permitted to provide NULL values for any of the
 * http_response arguments, indicating the caller is not interested in
 * those values. If the caller does provide an address, the HttpClient
 * stores at that address a pointer to the corresponding argument, at
