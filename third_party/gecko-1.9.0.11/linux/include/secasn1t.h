 * are parsed.  This is what you would do if you wanted to process the data
 * along the way (like to decrypt it, or to perform a hash on it in order
 * to do a signature check later).  See SEC_ASN1DecoderSetFilterProc().
 * When processing only part of the encoded bytes is desired, you "watch"
 * for the field(s) you are interested in with a "notify proc" (see
 * SEC_ASN1DecoderSetNotifyProc()) and for even finer granularity (e.g. to
 * ignore all by the contents bytes) you pay attention to the "data_kind"
 * parameter.
 *
 * When encoding, this is the specification for the output function which
 * will receive the bytes as they are encoded.  The output function can
 * perform any postprocessing necessary (like hashing (some of) the data
 * to create a digest that gets included at the end) as well as shoving
 * the data off wherever it needs to go.  (In order to "tune" any processing,
 * you can set a "notify proc" as described above in the decoding case.)
 *
 * The parameters:
 * - "arg" is an opaque pointer that you provided at the same time you
 *   specified a function of this type
 * - "data" is a buffer of length "len", containing the encoded bytes
 * - "depth" is how deep in a nested encoding we are (it is not usually
 *   valuable, but can be useful sometimes so I included it)
 * - "data_kind" tells you if these bytes are part of the ASN.1 encoded
 *   octets for identifier, length, contents, or end-of-contents
