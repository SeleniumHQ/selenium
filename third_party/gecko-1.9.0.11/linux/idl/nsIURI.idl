 * URIs are essentially structured names for things -- anything. This interface

 *
 * This interface follows Tim Berners-Lee's URI spec (RFC2396) [1], where the
 * basic URI components are defined as such:
 * <pre> 
 *      ftp://username:password@hostname:portnumber/pathname

 *                    PrePath

 * The definition of the URI components has been extended to allow for
