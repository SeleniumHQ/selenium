 * has constant overhead and doesn't create any additional objects as part of
 * the pool management after construction time.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the objects being pooled are arrays or maps that can have
 * unlimited number of properties, they need to be cleaned before being
 * returned to the pool.
 *
 * Also note that {@see goog.object.clean} actually allocates an array to clean
 * the object passed to it, so simply using this function would defy the
 * purpose of using the pool.
 *
 * @param {number} initialCount Initial number of objects to populate the
 *     free pool at construction time.
 * @param {number} maxCount Maximum number of objects to keep in the free pool.
