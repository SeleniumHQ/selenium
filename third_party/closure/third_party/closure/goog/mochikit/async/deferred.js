/**
 * A Deferred represents the result of an asynchronous operation. A Deferred
 * instance has no result when it is created, and is "fired" (given an initial
 * result) by calling {@code callback} or {@code errback}.
 *
 * Once fired, the result is passed through a sequence of callback functions
 * registered with {@code addCallback} or {@code addErrback}. The functions may
 * mutate the result before it is passed to the next function in the sequence.
 *
 * Callbacks and errbacks may be added at any time, including after the Deferred
 * has been "fired". If there are no pending actions in the execution sequence
 * of a fired Deferred, any new callback functions will be called with the last
 * computed result. Adding a callback function is the only way to access the
 * result of the Deferred.
 *
 * If a Deferred operation is canceled, an optional user-provided cancellation
 * function is invoked which may perform any special cleanup, followed by firing
 * the Deferred's errback sequence with a {@code CanceledError}. If the
 * Deferred has already fired, cancellation is ignored.
 *
 * Deferreds may be templated to a specific type they produce using generics
 * with syntax such as:
 * <code>
 *   /** @type {goog.async.Deferred<string>} *&#47;
 *   var d = new goog.async.Deferred();
 *   // Compiler can infer that foo is a string.
 *   d.addCallback(function(foo) {...});
 *   d.callback('string');  // Checked to be passed a string
 * </code>
 * Since deferreds are often used to produce different values across a chain,
 * the type information is not propagated across chains, but rather only
 * associated with specifically cast objects.
 *
 * @param {Function=} opt_onCancelFunction A function that will be called if the
 *     Deferred is canceled. If provided, this function runs before the
 *     Deferred is fired with a {@code CanceledError}.
 * @param {Object=} opt_defaultScope The default object context to call
 *     callbacks and errbacks in.
