@mainpage A strict JSON parser and generator for Objective-C

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
format. This framework provides two apis for parsing and generating
JSON. One standard object-based and a higher level api consisting of
categories added to existing Objective-C classes.

Learn more on the http://code.google.com/p/json-framework project site.
