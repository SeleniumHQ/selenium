JSON SDK (iPhone / iPhone Simulator / MacOS 10.5)
=================================================

Copy the content of the 'SDKs' folder to ~/Library/SDKs. (You may have
to create that directory.)

To make use of this SDK, select your target in the left-hand menu and
click the blue Info button (Apple-i). Add the following new line to
the "Additional SDKs" option: "$HOME/Library/SDKs/JSON/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk". 
Finally you have to add the entry '-ObjC -ljson' to the "Other Linker
Flags" option.

Embedded Framework
==================

Copy the '$PROJECT.framework' bundle to ~/Library/Frameworks. (You may
have to create that directory.)

Use the "Add existing file" menu to add the framework to your
application. You also have to add a "Copy files" build phase to copy the
framework into your application. This should copy files to the
Frameworks folder inside Resources.

hard-drive, cd into the directory and type 'make install'.
