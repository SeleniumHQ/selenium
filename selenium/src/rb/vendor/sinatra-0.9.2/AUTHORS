Sinatra was designed and developed by Blake Mizerany (bmizerany) in
California. Continued development would not be possible without the ongoing
financial support provided by [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and the emotional
support provided by Adam Wiggins (adamwiggins) of Heroku, Chris Wanstrath (defunkt),
PJ Hyett (pjhyett), and the rest of the GitHub crew.

Special thanks to the following extraordinary individuals, who-out which
Sinatra would not be possible:

* Ryan Tomayko (rtomayko) for constantly fixing whitespace errors 60d5006   
* Ezra Zygmuntowicz (ezmobius) for initial help and letting Blake steal
  some of merbs internal code.
* Christopher Schneid (cschneid) for The Book, the blog (gittr.com),
  irclogger.com, and a bunch of useful patches.
* Markus Prinz (cypher) for patches over the years, caring about
  the README, and hanging in there when times were rough.
* Simon Rozet (sr) for a ton of doc patches, HAML options, and all that
  advocacy stuff he's going to do for 1.0.
* Erik Kastner (kastner) for fixing `MIME_TYPES` under Rack 0.5.
* Ben Bleything (bleything) for caring about HTTP status codes and doc fixes.
* Igal Koshevoy (igal) for root path detection under Thin/Passenger.
* Jon Crosby (jcrosby) for coffee breaks, doc fixes, and just because, man.
* Karel Minarik (karmi) for screaming until the website came back up.
* Jeremy Evans (jeremyevans) for unbreaking optional path params (twice!)
* The GitHub guys for stealing Blake's table.
* Nickolas Means (nmeans) for Sass template support.
* Victor Hugo Borja (vic) for splat'n routes specs and doco.
* Avdi Grimm (avdi) for basic RSpec support.
* Jack Danger Canty for a more accurate root directory and for making me
  watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueaHLHgskkw) just now.
* Mathew Walker for making escaped paths work with static files.
* Millions of Us for having the problem that led to Sinatra's conception.
* Songbird for the problems that helped Sinatra's future become realized.
* Rick Olson (technoweenie) for the killer plug at RailsConf '08.
* Steven Garcia for the amazing custom artwork you see on 404's and 500's
* Pat Nakajima (nakajima) for fixing non-nested params in nested params Hash's.

and last but not least:

* Frank Sinatra (chairman of the board) for having so much class he
  deserves a web-framework named after him.
