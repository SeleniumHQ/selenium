Version number notation guide: 
The version number of the IEDriverServer.exe is in the pattern as follows:

  major.minor.build.revision

The "major" and "minor" fields are synchronized to releases of the Selenium
project. Changes in the "build" field indicate interim releases made publicly
available via the project downloads page. Changes in "revision" field indicate
private releases checked into the prebuilts directory of the source tree, but
not made generally available on the downloads page.

v2.26.2.6
=========
 * Fixed SendKeysCommandHandler to check that the focus is in the HTML display
   pane, and not some other UI element (like the address bar) before sending
   the keystrokes.

v2.26.2.5
=========
 * Added new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup". When set to true, the
   IE driver will clean the known-element cache of invalid elements after
   every page load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve
   performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this capability is
   provided temporarily to allow disabling this behavior if problems arise.
   The default of this new capability is "true", meaning this behavior is
   turned on by default.
 * Refactored IE driver Element class to contain IsAttachedToDom() method,
   and IECommandHandler::GetElement() to use it.
 * Modified to avoid logging the tag name of the element if getting the tag
   name fails in the IE driver. Fixes issue #4811.

v2.26.2.4
=========
 * Corrected fix to issue #4800 to better handle nested frames.
 * Refactored native code to return the location of each frame containing an
   element.
 * Refactored location methods of native IE driver code to take a LocationInfo
   struct instead of separate args for x, y, width and height.

v2.26.2.3
=========
 * On behalf of AdamWu: Fixed calculation of coordinates for elements in 
   frames/iframes where the element is scrolled out of view within the frame.
   Fixes issue #4800.

v2.26.2.2
=========
 * Disabled execution of JavaScript code on a separate thread for IE10. This
   reverts the behavior of the driver to that before 2.26.1.0 for IE10 *only*.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.26.2.1
=========
 * Modified to return ENOSUCHDRIVER if a session is not available.

v2.26.2.0
=========
 * Fixed synchronization issues. These issues were always present, but never
   manifested until the IE driver was used with IE 10.
 * Reinstating functionality to run JavaScript on a separate thread on Windows 8.

v2.26.1.2
=========
 * Removed functionality to run JavaScript on a separate thread on Windows 8.

v2.26.1.1
=========
 * Attempted to resolve crash on Windows 8 introduced by JavaScript execution
   on a separate thread. Added checks for proper interface marshaling on the
   worker thread.

v2.26.1.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered by onchange of <select>
   elements or by onsubmit of <form> elements. Fixes issue #3508. Fixes 
   issue #2103.

v2.26.0.9
=========
 * Modified scroll behavior in IE driver SendKeysCommandHandler to call 
   Element::GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView() instead of calling the DOM 
   scrollIntoView() function. Fixes issue #4393.
 * Modified to not call blur() on focusing element if the active element is
   the <body> element. This should no longer cause the IE window to drop to
   the bottom of the Z-order. Fixes issue #2353 and related.

v2.26.0.8
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.26.0.7
=========
 * Modified so that closing a window (or quitting a browser) now sets the 
   focused frame to NULL, as if switchTo().defaultContent() had been called.
   This is to prevent crashes of the executable when quitting the driver. Fixes
   issue #4178.

v2.26.0.6
=========
 * Added use of a mutex when creating a session. This should allow multiple
   threads to create and use different instances of IEDriverServer.exe,
   enabling multiple instances under most language bindings.
 * Added enablePersistentHover capability to allow users to turn off persistent
   mouse hover within the IE driver.

v2.26.0.5
=========
 * Refactored alert handling to allow handling of OnBeforeUnload dialogs. This
   is a slightly incomplete solution, as the dialog is not automatically
   handled on window close/browser exit. To work around this limitation,
   navigate to a different page (handling the OnBeforeUnload dialog), then
   call the quit() method.

v2.26.0.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.26.0.3
=========
 * Allowed buttons on alerts with control IDs of IDRETRY to be handled as 
   "OK" buttons, which should allow them to be handled by Alert.accept().

v2.26.0.2
=========
 * Modified find-by-XPath code to correctly escape embedded quotes before
   invoking the findElement atom.

v2.26.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updated to use Wicked Good XPath (http://code.google.com/p/wicked-good-xpath)
   as the XPath engine for the IE driver.

v2.26.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.25.3.6
=========
 * Modified behavior such that sending a Quit command on a non-existent
   session is now a no-op, and does not return an error code.

v2.25.3.5
=========
 * Added command-line switch to control to where the IEDriver.dll is extracted.
   Not specifying the switch causes the file to be extracted to the temp 
   directory.

v2.25.3.4
=========
 * Corrected searching for alert windows from windows opened by 
   showModalDialog().

v2.25.3.3
=========
 * Implemented "silent" command-line switch on IEDriverServer.exe to suppress
   printing to console of initial diagnostic information.

v2.25.3.2
=========
 * Implemented check in GetCurrentWindowHandleCommandHandler to verify that
   window handle is a valid window, returning a NoSuchWindowException if it
   is not. This was originally broken in r17651.

v2.25.3.1
=========
 * Implemented checks to ensure alerts are completely dismissed by IE before
   continuing to the next command.

v2.25.3.0
=========
 * Implemented automatic dismissal of alerts, settable by capability.
 * Implemented navigation back and forward through browser history on a
   separate thread, so as to no longer hang on alerts.

v2.25.2.3
=========
 * Fixed the case verifying whether a page in the browser is an HTML page, and
   the default browser does not register its MIME type in the (default) value
   at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<browser HTML page class name>. Fixes issue #4307.

v2.25.2.2
=========
 * Increased logging when getting registry values.
 * Fixed spacing in log messages 

v2.25.2.1
=========
 * Updated to return ENOSUCHWINDOW if trying to switch to a window ID that does
   not exist.

v2.25.2.0
=========
 * Fixed IE6 case for checking browser zoom level.
 * Now repeatedly sending WM_MOUSEMOVE messages on a separate thread to try to
   quell mouse hover issues.

v2.25.1.0
=========
 * Added error checking for zoom level for IE. The IE driver will now throw an
   exception if the zoom level isn't 100%. This behavior can be disabled in the
   IE driver by setting the "ignoreZoomLevel" capability. Fixes Issue #4272.
 * Stop execution when a call to IWebBrowser2::Navigate2() fails in the IE
   driver. This prevents a hang when we weren't checking for an error
   condition. Fixes issue #4279.

v2.25.0.0
=========
 * Handle quirky handling of mime types if Firefox was ever the default browser
   on a Windows installation, but now a different (non-IE) browser has stepped
   into that role.
 * Increased timeout for finding file upload dialog in uploading file. Fixes
   issue #3858.
 * Updated initialization of variables in MouseMoveToCommandHandler.h and in
   GetElementLocationOnceScrolledIntoViewCommandHandler.h. Fixes issue #4205.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.24.2.0
=========
 * Refactoring command line argument handling in IEDriverServer.exe, now that
   the number of valid arguments is growing.
 * Added ability to control log level and log file via command line switches to
   IEDriverServer.exe (on behalf of AlexandrSavchuk).
 * Re-added else-if for GetSessionList command inadvertently removed in r15345.
   Fixes issue #4160.
 * Added logging message to a large portion of the IE driver (on behalf of 
   AlexandrSavchuk). Set the log file with

       --log-file="C:\full\path\to\filename.log"

   (default is to log to the console). Set the logging level with

       --log-level=LOGLEVEL

   where LOGLEVEL is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL (default
   is FATAL). Fixes issue #4159

v2.24.1.0
=========
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.24.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.23.2.0
=========
 * Crash prevention for when there is no "current" browser window, like when
   the current window is closed without the user switching to another window.
   Fixes issue #4071.

v2.23.1.1
=========
 * Crash prevention for when IWebBrowser2::get_Document() returns S_FALSE.
   Fixes issue #4064.

v2.23.1.0
=========
 * Updated error messaging for certain conditions of Element.Click()

v2.23.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.22.1.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.22.1.0
=========
 * Re-enabling native code driver to understand "nativeEvents" capability.
   This was disabled due to CI-build restrictions which have now been resolved.

v2.22.0.0
=========
 * Initial release required by client language bindings.
