Version number notation guide: 
The version number of the IEDriverServer.exe is in the pattern as follows:

  major.minor.build.revision

The "major" and "minor" fields are synchronized to releases of the Selenium
project. Changes in the "build" field indicate interim releases made publicly
available via the project downloads page. Changes in "revision" field indicate
private releases checked into the prebuilts directory of the source tree, but
not made generally available on the downloads page.

v3.150.2.0
==========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Changed source to compile against Windows 10 SDK. This means that the
   executable may no longer run on versions of Windows less than Windows 10.

v3.150.1.1
==========
 * Made checking of the Content-Length header case-insensitive. This fixes
   a number of issues where sessions cannot be started or where commands
   fail because the HTTP client made a choice to not use properly-cased
   header names.

v3.150.1.0
==========
 * Reverted change to use effective style for determining element visibility.
   If a containing element has scrollbars, simply using the client bounding
   rect to determine the click point could lead the click point behind a
   scrollbar be determined as "in view," when clicking on the point would
   instead click on the scrollbar. A previous fix for this issue was not
   sufficiently robust in all scenarios, leading some elements to be seen
   as not displayed at all. Accordingly, this change has been reverted
   until a more correct one can be created.
 * Other updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v3.150.0.0
==========
 * (on behalf of Stanley Hon) Added basic support for IEDriver to drive
   Chromium-based Edge in Internet Explorer mode. Users can do this by
   setting the `ie.edgechromium` property to `true`, and by supplying
   the path to the Chromium-based Edge executable in the `ie.edgepath`
   property of the `se:ieOptions` capability object. Note that this
   feature is only available on Windows, as Chromium-based Edge only
   supports Internet Explorer Mode on Windows. Moreover, users cannot
   switch session types from normal mode to Internet Explorer Mode or
   vice-versa; only one session type is allowed.
 * Made driver work with <map> and <area> elements
 * (on behalf of Marc Fisher) Fixed FTP and HTTP proxy markers for setting
   web proxy with the IE driver. Fixes issue #7152.
 * Added additional error information to error messages encountered during
   navigation.
 * Removed support from IE driver for "desiredCapabilities" in new session
   requests. The W3C WebDriver Specification does not recognize any property
   in the payload for the new session command other than "capabilities". The
   IE driver has long supported the presence of "desiredCapabilities" as a
   fallback for older, obsolete language bindings. Now that we are in the
   process of creating the Selenium 4.0 language bindings, this legacy
   compatibility should no longer be necessary. Users using this version of
   the IE driver with language bindings prior to 4.0 may encounter issues
   if the bindings do not properly format the new session request;
   nevertheless, this change will not be reverted, as future versions of the
   language bindings should properly format the new session command.

v3.141.59.3
===========
 * Made driver calculate viewport with window.innerHeight/Width instead of
   using documentElement.clientHeight/Width. This follows the definitions of
   the W3C WebDriver Specification for calculating the in-view center point of
   an element.
 * Fixed to return empty object from JavaScript instead of null.
 * Fixed IE driver to ignore unknown timeouts for set timeout command.
   According to the W3C WebDriver Specification, additional timeouts not
   specified are valid syntax, though they are ignored by the driver.
 * Updated driver to allow detection of alerts with 'do not create' checkbox.

v3.141.59.2
===========
 * Slightly modified setting IE window to have focus when sending input.
   This code only affects the browser when the requireWindowFocus
   capability is set at session start.

v3.141.59.1
===========
 * Added checking for max expiriation date in IE driver cookie handling.
   Attempting to add a cookie with a very large expiration date caused
   the IE driver to crash because of overflows in the C++ standard library
   time formatting functions. This commit now avoids the crash by
   enforcing a maximum cookie expiration time of 2,147,483,647 (2^32 - 1)
   seconds from the time the cookie is attempting to be set. At the time
   of this writing (2019), that means an expiration of the cookie sometime
   over 68 years into the future (2087). If the intended expiration time
   is beyond that limit, the driver will now return "unable to set cookie"
   error.

   As an internal implementation detail, the driver is migrating from the
   "expires" attribute to the "max-age" attribute of the cookie string,
   as versions of IE below 9 are no longer supported. Additionally, while
   it would be possible to use "expires" and get a longer expiration time,
   (somewhere around the year 3000), the distinction between a cookie
   expiring after 68 years and one expiring in just under 1000 years is
   (or ought to be) largely meaningless in the context of a website.
   Fixes issue #7122.

v3.141.59.0
===========
 * Rollup of fixes since previous release. No additional changes.

v3.141.5.13
===========
 * Fixed execution of user JavaScript to allow comment at end of line.

v3.141.5.12
===========
 * (on behalf of Reinhold Degenfellner) Updated to allow retries for finding
   the upload file selection dialog. Fixes issue #6991.
 * Modified to prevent navigation to directories using file:// protocol.
   Navigating to a directory will open a Windows Explorer window, not open
   the directory in the IE frame, and there is no way to automate the
   resulting window. This is a deliberate deviation from the W3C WebDriver
   Specification, as it's impossible to yield spec-compliant behavior from
   Internet Explorer.
 * Made driver return lowercase utf-8 for charset in content-type header.

v3.141.5.11
===========
 * (on behalf of Reinhold Degenfellner) Fixed crash when attempting to
   upload files. Fixes issue #6976.

v3.141.5.10
===========
 * (on behalf of Ben Kucera) Updated proxy settings to set proxy bypass
   addresses. Fixes issue #6086.
 * Updated to be able to close Windows 10 credentials dialog. When Microsoft
   updated Windows 10's credentials prompt dialog, they made it a dialog
   that is not a standard alert dialog and therefore not able to be
   automated using standard Windows automation techniques. With a recent
   preview release, it became possible to manipulate this dialog using
   the UI Automation feature of Windows. The driver will now be able
   to accept or dismiss this credentials dialog now. Please note that
   there is still no supported solution for entering credentials, as
   there is no support for that feature in the W3C WebDriver Specification.

v3.141.5.9
==========
 * Enabled serialization of the FileList object from file upload elements
   (the return value of the files property in JavaScript).
 * Improved recognition of Protected Mode boundary crossing on navigation,
   particularly with URLs beginning with "about:blank"

v3.141.5.8
==========
 * Improved driver use with invalid Protected Mode settings. Currently,
   when the user does not set the Protected Mode settings of the browser
   and sends the capability to bypass the checks for those settings,
   the driver will attempt to predict when a Protected Mode boundary
   will be crossed, and set in motion a process to reattach itself to
   the newly created browser. This process is far from perfect. It is
   subject to really challenging race conditions that are truly impossible
   to eliminate entirely, because of the architecture of the browser
   itself. Nevertheless, even in its flawed state, this is still a better
   outcome than it was previously for users.

   Please note that the advice and support policy of the IE driver will
   continue to be that the user must set the Protected Mode settings of
   the browser properly before using the driver. Any "issues" that arise
   by not having the settings set, but that disappear when the settings
   are corrected, are not considered by the project to be valid issues.
   This will include, but not be limited to, issues like abandoned
   browser instances not being closed, use of multiple instances of the
   driver where the wrong browser window is connected to and automated,
   and issues where the driver appears to hang upon navigation to a new
   page. If the problem disappears when the browser is properly
   configured, any issue reports will be immediately closed with a note
   to properly configure the browser and remove the capability.

   The following situations should be at least partially mitigated by the
   change:

   * Navigation to a new page
   * Clicking on a link (specifically an <a> tag) that will lead to a
     navigation to a new page
   * Clicking a link that opens a new window

   Other cases, like navigating backward and forward through the browser
   history, clicking an element that submits a form, and so on, may not
   be handled. In those cases, issue reports will be summarily closed,
   unless a specific pull request fixing the issue is also provided.
   Additionally, use of things like proxies to capture traffic between the
   browser and web server may miss some traffic because of the race
   conditions inherent in the mechanism used to reattach to a newly
   created browser. Again, these race conditions are unavoidable, and
   issue reports that are based on them will be immediately closed with a
   note indicating that the browser must have its settings properly set.
   These strict guidelines are not intended to be harsh, and are not put
   in place with the intent to avoid investigating and fixing issues;
   rather, they must be enforced because the underlying architecture of
   the browser makes them unavoidable.

v3.141.5.7
==========
 * Fixed uninitialized variable in driver.

v3.141.5.6
==========
 * Fixed proper keyboard event values for extended keys.

v3.141.5.5
==========
 * Added hack for handling cases where document.designMode is on.
   In IE, when document.designMode is turned on, the browser is put
   into a state where anonymous JavaScript functions cannot be run.
   Obviously, this breaks a huge portion of the driver, so the driver
   will now force documents out of designMode when attempting to
   execute script. There should be vanishingly few real-world cases
   where this has an adverse effect, with most sites using the
   contentEditable attribute instead.

v3.141.5.4
==========
 * Added hack for detection of IE in full screen mode.

v3.141.5.3
==========
 * Again updated Unicode character processing for composition. The
   previous change in 3.141.5.1 for using composed Unicode character
   sequences on send and decomposed on retrieve was disturbingly
   naive, and entirely incorrect. This revision mostly reverts that
   change, with the difference of checking for "single-character"
   encoding sequences when sending. The IE driver will no longer
   produce the same input for some key combinations as other
   drivers (see some Hangul sequences for concrete examples). The
   mitigating factor of this difference in behavior, however, is
   that the driver should now produce identical input and output
   between sending keys and reading the text via either getting an
   element's text or its attributes. Hopefully. There are likely
   to continue to be corner cases where use of Unicode characters,
   does not entirely match up to expectations. This is particularly
   so in languages where individual code points can be combined to
   form other glyphs identical to other individual code points.

v3.141.5.2
==========
 * Enabled create new window command to create tabs. This change
   overcomes the limitation of only creating top-level browser
   contexts in new top-level windows. The IE driver can now open
   new tabs when using the create new window command, as in the
   .NET language bindings:

       driver.SwitchTo().NewWindow(WindowType.Tab);

   Note carefully that this change is only valid when explicitly
   using the create new window command. It does not affect clicking
   on links that open new top-level browsing contexts; those will
   continue to open in new top-level windows. Furthermore, it is
   imperative to note that this feature will absolutely not work
   when Protected Mode properties are misconfigured. In other words,
   if your code uses the .NET InternetExplorerOptions
   `IntroduceInstabilityByIgnoringProtectedModeSettings` property
   (or its equivalent in any other language bindings), this feature
   will not work. Issue reports submitted regarding this will be
   summarily closed.

v3.141.5.1
==========
 * Implemented create new window commmand. The W3C WebDriver
   Specification recently added the ability to create a new top-level
   browsing context, or what appears to the user to be a new tab or
   window. This change implements that command. Though the command
   payload contains a hint argument as to what type of new top-level
   browsing context the user desires (tab or window), the driver
   implementation is free to ignore this type hint if it does not
   support the type being requested. Since the IE driver has never
   supported, and still does not support, creation of new top-level
   browsing contexts using a new tab, in accordance with the spec, the
   driver will create the new context in a new window, even if a new
   tab is requested. Please note this is not a bug; it is as designed,
   and is still fully compliant with the specification with this
   behavior.
 * Fixed edge case for clicking element. In the case of a fixed element
   where the top-left corner of the element is outside the view port,
   the click point calculation was not taking the offset of the top-
   left when looking for the in-view center of the element. This change
   fixes that issue.
 * Updated Unicode character processing for combining characters. In a
   previous revision, the IE driver was modified to normalize Unicode
   strings that used combining characters to compose a single glyph when
   sending keystrokes. This commit implements the reverse of that
   operation when reading text data, decomposing the glyph into its
   combining characters if required. This is a potential destablizing
   change for text sequences that use combining characters, and care
   should be taken by users to understand the potential differences if
   handling text using such character combinations causes unexpected
   results.
 * Corrected error statuses returned for switching frames. The IE
   driver now returns the correct status as specified by the W3C
   WebDriver Specification for error conditions encountered when
   attempting to switch frames.
 * Modified to allow null value for script timeout. The W3C WebDriver
   Specification has contradictory language regarding the script
   timeout. On the one hand, it specifies that the value of the script
   timeout can be `null`, indicating an indefinite timeout. On the
   other hand, it specifies that when setting or getting timeouts, the
   value of any timeout must be an integer between 0 and 2^53 - 1.
   Since geckodriver has made the assumption that the former condition
   is the correct interpretation, and the maintainers of geckodriver
   have added a test to the W3C Web Platform Tests for WebDriver that
   expects this interpretation, the IE driver is being modified to
   follow that decision. It is the opinion of the developers of the IE
   driver that this is the incorrect interpretation, but there is no
   recourse to have the geckodriver maintainers revisit their decision.

v3.141.5.0
==========
 * Added logging of JavaScript errors when executing scripts.
 * Fixed incorrect error response format for invalid commands in IE.
   Previously, when an invalid command was sent to the IE driver, the
   response was not completely valid for the W3C dialect of the wire
   protocol. In particular, the distinction was lost between an unknown
   URL and an invalid HTTP verb, and this code was not properly converted
   when the driver was updated to implement the specification. This change
   fixes that. Correct responses are now sent back for both invalid
   command cases. Additionally, the driver no longer hand-codes JSON for
   these responses, instead creating a valid Response object, and using
   the common serialization mechanism for transmission. Finally, this
   commit includes some minor code formatting cleanup, which does not
   affect the functionality of the driver. Fixes issue #6828.

v3.141.0.6
==========
 * Modified to allow the driver to handle supplementary Unicode characters
   in sendKeys. The IE driver lost the ability to check for surrogate
   pairs after implementing spec compliance in 3.5. The driver will still
   convert the keys being sent using sendKeys from UTF-8 to UTF-16 (Windows
   development default for wide strings), but it will now properly
   check for supplementary characters by checking for surrogate pairs.
 * Moved normalization of Unicode strings to InputManager. Rather than
   normalizing every conversion from UTF-8, it is more correct to only
   perform the normalization when using the Unicode strings for keyboard
   input. Accordingly, the normalization code is being moved from
   StringUtilities to the InputManager class.

v3.141.0.5
==========
 * Updated element obscured algorithm to handle shadow DOM polyfills. Shadow
   DOM for IE is problematic. Shadow DOM is only available in IE as a
   polyfill. If an element is part of a Shadow DOM (using a polyfill), IE's
   elementsFromPoint implementation will show the component elements, not
   necessarily the Web Component root element itself. If the direct parent
   of the Web Component host element is in this list, then it counts as a
   direct descendent, and won't be obscured. Note that a potential
   enhancement to this change is to walk the DOM tree up until an ancestor
   is found that does not have a shadow root, but that enhancement is not
   implemented at present.
 * Added synchronization code. The IE driver can only handle one command
   at a time. Commands from multithreaded client libraries should block
   on the second thread's command until the first thread's executing command
   is complete.
 * Reverted earlier change to the obscured element algorithm. The previous
   changes were incorrect. Any value other than 'none' for the pointerEvents
   CSS property on a non-SVG element will result in the element receiving
   pointer events.
 * Removed isFocusable atom from sendKeys command. The isFocusable atom
   does not provide the correct information as to whether an element is
   focusable according to the W3C and WHATWG DOM specifications. This
   change removes the use of that atom, and relies instead on the abililty
   to set focus to the element before sending the keystrokes.

v3.141.0.4
==========
 * Fixed to correctly set Content-length header for HTTP responses.
   Not setting this header properly is a protocol violation, and strict
   HTTP clients (like .NET's HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse) will reject
   such an HTTP response for the 1.1 version of the HTTP protocol.
 * Reduced JavaScript errors during findElement(s). In most cases, executing
   JavaScript is an atomic action for the IE driver. However, in the off
   chance that there is a page refresh during the execution of JavaScript,
   converting the result of the script to a JSON object for serialization
   might cause an error, in which case we should return the appropriate
   error to the caller. One place, however, where this might be common is
   executing findElement(s) across a page navigation. This change makes the
   driver return the proper error in the post-processing of a script
   execution. It also recognizes the findElement(s) case, ignoring
   JavaScript errors in finding elements, and returning the proper structure
   (an empty list or a "no such element" error) in its place. This lets
   things like explicit waits retry the find, which may succeed once the
   page navigation has completed and the DOM available for querying again.
 * Tweaked obscured element algorithm. The algorithm used by the IE driver
   to detect obscured elements checks the value of the pointer-events CSS
   computed style property. This property can have valid values of "auto"
   and "none" which affect whether to consider an element "obscured."
   However, the property can also contain other values for SVG elements.
   If the element in question is not an SVG element, then values other
   than "none" and "auto" must be ignored, and the element considered not
   to obscure the target element.
 * Fixed compile warnings.

v3.141.0.3
==========
 * Updated Civetweb dependency to version 1.11.
 * Modified IE driver to no longer always send Connection: close header.
   This is a potentially destablizing change, as the driver now should
   correctly use keep-alive for HTTP requests and responses. While this
   should not matter, the driver has not ever executed true with keep-
   alive connections, so care should be used.

v3.141.0.2
==========
 * Updating IE scroll-into-view algorithm for element click.
   This update makes the scroll-into-view algorithm for element click
   to be compliant with the W3C WebDriver Specification.
 * Completed IE implementation of strictFileInteractability capability.
   By default, the IE driver can interact with hidden <input type='file'>
   elements. By setting this capability to false, it forces the driver
   to make sure the file upload element is interactable like other
   elements.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v3.141.0.1
==========
 * Updated error message return from unserializable JavaScript results. In
   the case where a user JavaScript execution completes successfully, but
   the resulting option is not serializable via JSON (because of cyclical
   references or similar), the error message that the execution errored due
   to the failed serialization was being suppressed.
 * Added support for strictFileInteractability capability. The latest
   editors' drafts of the W3C WebDriver Specification as a living  document
   have introduce the "strictFileInteractability" capability for handling
   <input type='file'> elements. This change makes the driver aware of that
   capability.
 * Removed premature break statements in obscured element check. When
   looping through the elements returned by elementsFromPoint, the driver
   was calling a break statement early, preventing clear error messages for
   which element is obscuring the element to be clicked.

v3.141.0.0
==========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Version number updated to continue with "digits of pi" theme.

v3.14.0.15
==========
 * Fixed change in behavior recognizing closing of showModalDialog windows.
   Fixes issue #6574.

v3.14.0.14
==========
 * Fixed retrieval of CSS properties that return non-string values. Fixes
   issue #6527.

v3.14.0.13
==========
 * Fixed multiple file upload element detection.

v3.14.0.12
==========
 * Allowed duration property of pause actions to be omitted.
 * Cleaned up variant copying for getElementAttribute command.
 * Expanded inline element detection for obscured elements. This commit
   expands on the hack that was introduced in 3.14.0.11. It turns out
   that <label> elements are not the only ones to suffer from issues
   with elementsFromPoint. Rather, we now check for all types of inline
   elements. This change also refactors the calculation of the hit-
   testing point for calling elementsFromPoint in the first place, as
   it only makes sense to call from within the context of the element's
   document (omitting frames).

v3.14.0.11
==========
 * Added hack to obscured element check for label elements. As per the
   W3C WebDriver Specification, the IE driver uses elementsFromPoint to
   determine whether an element being clicked on is obscured. However,
   there is a bug in the IE implementation of elementsFromPoint that if
   the element parent tree contains a <label> element, that element is
   omitted from the list of elements returned by elementsFromPoint. This
   change is to work around that bug. The solution implemented here is
   to check if the top-most element as returned by elementFromPoint is
   a direct descendent of the element we want to click on, and the 
   element we want to click on is a <label>, we assume the element is
   not obscured. Note carefully that this is a hack of the highest
   order, and there's every likelihood that some page, somewhere will
   fail this check. Upon receiving an issue report with a complete
   reproduction case that includes a page clearly demonstrating the
   issue, we will then revisit this algorithm.

v3.14.0.10
==========
 * Partially reverted obscured element check. The updated obscured check
   introduced in 3.14.0.8 assumed that there was a bug in IE's implementation
   of elementsFromPoint. This is not the case. The actual bug is that the
   driver did not take into account elements found outside the DOM tree of
   the element being interacted with should not be flagged as obscuring the
   target element if its pointer-events CSS property is "none". This is
   because while the element may technically be rendered above the target
   element in the DOM, it does not interfere with attempts to interact with
   elements below it, since pointer events are not triggered.

v3.14.0.9
=========
 * Added ability to return text of JavaScript errors. Until this change,
   if the IE driver encountered an error in a user's JavaScript, there was
   no way to return the actual error text. This change fixes that. The text
   of the JavaScript error will be returned so it can be used as part of
   the exception thrown by the language bindings.

v3.14.0.8
=========
 * Updated obscured element check. The W3C WebDriver Specification dictates
   that checking for elements being obscured by other elements should rely
   on calling elementsFromPoint. However, there is a bug in IE's
   elementsFromPoint implementation. if two sibling elements have the same
   z-index, the one specified second in the DOM order is usually on top.
   The exception is if there is a child element that has a specified
   z-index greater than the ancestor z-index. The IE elementsFromPoint
   implementation ignores the child element case, so we have to manually
   look for child elements that may be rendered on top of the element found
   outside the element DOM tree of the element we are attempting to interact
   with.

v3.14.0.7
=========
 * Instituted limits on x and y offsets for actions.
 * Corrected finding of extracted dll on startup.

v3.14.0.6
=========
 * Updated to make JSON serialization of JavaScript objects more compliant.
   When returning values from user-specified JavaScript, the presence of a
   toJSON() property indicates that function is what should be used to
   serialize the object. Additionally, for objects that are not recognized
   as JavaScript objects via the properties of the IDispatch, and do not
   have a toJSON property, the driver will now make a last-ditch attempt
   to serialize the value for return by calling JSON.stringify().

v3.14.0.5
=========
 * Updated to manually initialize cookie manager on new window open. When
   a new window is requested by the browser, the driver creates one, but
   does not set the window handle of the window to a proper value. This
   is normally not an issue, but in the edge case where the user wants to
   manipulate cookies in the new window, the cookie manager does not have
   a window handle set to facilitate the transfer of cookie information
   from the driver code to the browser. This change rectifies that problem.

v3.14.0.4
=========
 * Updated to return 500 for timeouts instead of 408. Some HTTP clients
   would retry when receiving a 408 status code. Switching to 500 resolves
   that issue.
 * Updated driver for the case of clicking element with children. The
   case where one attempts to click on an element that must be scrolled into
   view, and where the element has child elements, but the first node is a
   text node was broken for IE. In this case, to guarantee the proper element
   is clicked (and that an embedded child does not receive the click), the
   driver would attempt to click on the text node. However, the coordinate
   calculation when the element had to be scrolled into view was flawed. This
   commit changes from using the boundingLeft and boundingTop properties of
   IHTMLTextRangeMetrics to using offsetLeft and offsetTop in an attempt to
   correct the calculation of the location of the text to be clicked on.
 * Updated driver to return non-integer values for element rect.
 * Made driver spec compliant for setting largest timeout value.
 * Updated to properly find XML documents for element enabled and CSS values
 * Refactored opening and closing of new browser windows. This simplifies,
   streamlines, and makes more robust the driver code responsible for finding
   new browser windows when opened by users' code, like clicking a link that
   opens the target in a new browser window. It also simplifies the code that
   executes when a browser window is closed. There is a chance this change
   introduces a slight performance delay in the process of opening a new
   browser window, but in the interest of making the driver more robust, it
   is preferable to live with the delay and figure out a way to reduce or
   eliminate it later.

v3.14.0.3
=========
 * Updated to properly validate duration property of pause actions.

v3.14.0.2
=========
 * Robustness change for invalid command payloads to comply with W3C Spec.
 * Updated to truncate obscured element click error message to a reasonable
   length.
 * Handle null pointers for cookie values. Fixes issue #6261.

v3.14.0.1
=========
 * Updated to properly set the "path" property on cookies when a document
   is specified in the property.

v3.14.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Modified to prevent attempt to return IDispatch that is not IHTMLElement.
   When returning values from JavaScript, if a variant value is an IDispatch,
   but does not implement IHTMLElement, and also is not recognized as a
   JavaScript array or object, avoid returning it from the script. This is
   also to prevent returning things like a window or document reference, as
   those items contain recursive references that cannot be properly
   serialized to JSON.
 * (on behalf of Mike Bellew) Fixed null pointer exception when managed
   element is not found. The command executor has a chance to return an error
   code of ENOSUCHELEMENT when executing scripts. This leaves the element
   wrapper object equal to null, which in turn ends up throwing an exception
   on the next like of code when it tries to use the element. This would
   cause a crash in IEDriver and it shuts down

v3.13.0.5
=========
 * Modified to silently dismiss onbeforeupdate dialogs. The W3C WebDriver
   Specification dictates that all onbeforeupdate dialogs are automatically
   dismissed without notification. This commit brings the IE driver into
   compliance with that part of the spec.
 * Resetting frame focus to top-level frame on refresh. The W3C WebDriver
   Specification dictates that issuing the Refresh command will reset the
   focus to the top-level frame. This commit brings the IE driver into
   compliance with that part of the spec.

v3.13.0.4
=========
 * Made set window rect command spec-compliant for x and y coordinates

v3.13.0.3
=========
 * Fixed crashing bug in obscured element detection.
 * Modified to extract IE internal library to IEDriver.tmp first.
   If the file IEDriver.tmp exists in the destination directory, then use
   the result of the `GetTempFileName` API, which results in a file named
   "IEDxxxxx.tmp" where "xxxxx" is a random number.
 * Added version resources to internal IE driver library.

v3.13.0.2
=========
 * Modified to prevent keyup actions if key is not already down for IE.
   This change now checks that a specified key is down before sending any
   input events when a keyUp action is specified. This prevents spurious
   events detected by the browser, events which cannot happen with an actual
   user.
 * Refactored IE sendKeys command handler to handle multiple file uploads.
   Until now, the IE driver has not handled the "multiple" attribute for
   <input type="file"> elements. This construct is now supported, and it is
   possible to specify multiple files for upload if the multiple attribute is
   set on the <input> element. To do so, use a string containing full path
   and file name to each file to be uploaded, separated by new line
   characters (e.g.: "C:\path\to\file\one.txt\nC:\path\to\file\two.txt"). One
   caveat to this approach is that when specifying multiple files, all files
   must be located in the same directory. This is not a limitation imposed by
   the driver; it is a limitation imposed by IE itself. It is a known
   limitation, and cannot be fixed in the driver until and unless the browser
   allows it.
 * Added wait for navigation to IE accept and dismiss alert commands. When
   accepting or dismissing an alert, particularly when it is raised during
   the onload event, it is possible for the driver to not recognize that
   navigation is still pending once the alert is handled. This change is an
   attempt at better allowing the driver to recognize this situation and act
   accordingly.

v3.13.0.1
=========
 * Updated to automatically dismiss onBeforeUnload event dialogs. This is a
   change from previous behavior, where such dialogs were handled via the
   standard alert handling commands. The W3C WebDriver Specification demands
   that onBeforeUnload dialogs be dismissed automatically, with no input
   allowed for the user. This may be a breaking change for some users who are
   currently relying on the alert-handling commands to handle these alerts;
   however, not implementing this behavior makes the driver not compliant with
   the specificiation. Users in that state will have no choice but to modify
   their code to accomodate the new, spec-compliant behavior.
 * Updated the reset action to be spec-compliant. This means that when the
   "Release Actions" command is sent, that pressed keystrokes and mouse
   buttons are reset to the "up" position in the correct order.
 * Corrected "invalid session id" response to be spec-compliant

v3.13.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v3.12.0.5
=========
 * Updating to indicate elements with 'pointer-events' style of 'none' as
   obscured, triggering "element click intercepted" error response. This is
   in keeping with the W3C WebDriver Specification that demands this behavior.

v3.12.0.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Use elementFromPoint for IE driver in determining obscured elements. This
   is in direct violation of the algorithm specified in the W3C WebDriver
   Specification, but it fixes a class of IE-specific bugs that present
   themselves when using elementsFromPoint. This is used to shortcut the use
   of elementsFromPoint if it is not necessary.
 * Added additional logging to IE driver for setting window focus.
 * Updated IE driver to use SendInput for a single input at a time. The IE
   driver uses the Windows `SendInput` API when a session is initiated with
   the `requireWindowFocus` capability. This is a low-level user input
   simulation API, and very closely mimics the use of a physical mouse and
   keyboard. One of the guarantees of the API is that when one sends an array
   of `INPUT` structures, then no input messages can be inserted into the
   middle of the input stream. However, it appears that there are cases where
   sending multiple input structures that IE does not process all of them.
   This leads to truncated or missing keys when using the Selenium sendKeys
   method. This change makes the driver use SendInput, but only passing a
   single INPUT structure at a time. This is dangerous, in that it allows
   other inputs to potentially be slipped into the input stream. This change
   makes the driver prefer one form of instability (potentially unwanted
   input events) over another (input events not processed by the browser).

   Additionally, this change introduces an additional method for forcing the
   IE window into focus before sending input. This additional method uses the
   Windows UI Automation accessibility API to do this. The potential down
   side to using this (apparently) more reliable mechanism is that it may
   introduce a slight performance penalty, as the UI Automation API is
   notoriously slow. In practice, this performance penalty is observed to be
   on the order of milliseconds, so the trade-off here is deemed worth the
   risk, and there is no way to disable this new check.

v3.12.0.3
=========
 * Refactored IE waiting for page load on click. This commit restores some
   previously lost functionality for waiting for a page to load on click of
   an element. The race condition for detecting when a navigation is started
   is mitigated by a short wait (50ms) on the click.
 * Made "eager" page load strategy not wait for frame navigation to be
   completed before returning.

v3.12.0.2
=========
 * Added log warning for mismatched bitness of driver and browser when
   sending keys.
 * Updated to better support using CreateProcess API for launching IE.
   The driver checks the registry for the location of the iexplore.exe
   executable. In the case of a 32-bit driver on 64-bit Windows, the
   registry calls are redirected to the Wow6432Node in the registry,
   which ultimately points to ielowutl.exe instead of iexplore.exe. In
   this case, we will now bypass the registry redirection, and read the
   proper location from the 64-bit browser executable. A side effect of
   this is that users wanting to use the CreateProcess API will need to
   use the 64-bit version of the IE driver on 64-bit Windows, contrary to
   most expectations. It is important to note that using this API and
   launching the browser in this way is not consistent with how the user
   will launch IE, and if the driver is used for testing purposes, it will
   not be giving identical results to what the end-user of the application
   being tested will use when running IE.

v3.12.0.1
=========
 * Update close window command to return list of remaining window handles.
   This makes the command consistent with the W3C WebDriver Specification.
   Unfortunately, to accurately return the proper list, however, this
   requires the driver to wait for the window to be completely closed. In
   previous versions, this was an asynchronous operation, and could return
   immediately. With this change, the driver must wait for the window to
   be successfully closed, and this change therefore introduces a slight
   performance delay when windows are closed. The performance hit is
   unfortunate, but unavoidable.

v3.12.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added alert text to error response for unexpected alerts. This is to
   maintain consistency with other implementations.
 * Added checking of variant type for returns from JavaScript execution.
   In order to prevent false positives when checking whether a returned
   variant is an array or object, make sure the returned type of the
   variant is VT_DISPATCH.

v3.11.1.6
=========
 * Changed to throw an error for key actions taking multiple characters in IE.
   The key actions as defined by the W3C WebDriver Specification take a JSON
   payload that requires the resulting key for the key down or key up action
   to resolve to a single Unicode code point or a single grapheme cluster
   (what appears to be a single logical "character" from a user's
   perspective). The IE driver will now evaluate the item passed into the key
   down or key up action, and, taking combining characters into account,
   attempts to make sure there is only a single grapheme present, if more
   than one Unicode code point is sent. If the entered string would results
   in multiple grapheme clusters, the driver now returns an invalid argument
   error, as per the spec.
 * Updated find element by link text atom to handle non-breaking spaces.
   The WebDriver W3C Specification states that when finding by link text, the
   text of a link element (<a>) should be trimmed of leading and trailing
   whitespace after calling getVisibleText on the element before comparison.
   Links with text that contains leading or trailing non-breaking spaces
   (&nbsp) were having the non-breaking spaces converted to regular spaces,
   but not trimmed after the fact. This commit corrects that oversight.
 * Made IE cookie expiration times integer values. Some WebDriver
   implementations have used floating point values for the expiration time of
   a cookie as serialized in the wire protocol. The W3C WebDriver Specification
   dictates that expriation times should be integer values. This commit makes
   the driver conform to the specification.
 * Modified to throw exception clicking on file upload elements in IE.
   The WebDriver W3C Specification states that if a user attempts to click a
   file upload element (<input type="file">), an error should be returned.
   This is consistent with the intended behavior of WebDriver from the start,
   which is that to upload a file, one should use sendKeys, not click() on
   the input element. This now codifies that behavior with returning an
   error. Note that if users have erroneously been using click() with file
   upload elements, then using some external library (Robot Framework,
   Sikuli, etc.) to handle the resulting file selection dialog, their
   code will now break, in that the click() method will throw an exception,
   and the element will not be clicked. Those users should update their code
   accordingly.

v3.11.1.5
=========
 * Initial implementation of taking element screenshots. This is an extremely
   naive implmementation, and should not be considered complete.

v3.11.1.4
=========
 * Fixed finding child elements to return proper error if parent element is
   stale. Fixes issue #5700.

v3.11.1.3
=========
 * Fixed detection of obscured elements when top element is not displayed.
   Fixes issue #5668.

v3.11.1.2
=========
 * Changed COM variant to JSON serialization in IE. There is an expectation
   that if a result from JavaScript is "integral," that it is serialized for
   return to the calling code as an integral number rather than a floating-
   point number. Previous versions of the JSON serializer used by the IE
   driver would (incorrectly) serialize a floating-point value with no
   decimal part as being an integer. After updating to a later version, the
   serializer now (correctly) serializes floating-point values as floating-
   point values, with a trailing ".0" to indicate a floating-point value.
   While this is the correct behavior by the serializer, it breaks the
   expectations of the language bindings. Therefore, we check to see if the
   variant value has a decimal part, and if it has none, convert it to an
   integer for serialization by the JSON library.
 * Updated JsonCpp library to latest source code. Fixes issue #5664.

v3.11.1.1
=========
 * Separated out detection of focusable elements for sendKeys in IE. Allows
   separate error messages for attempting to send keys to a non-focusable
   element. Also fixes sending keystrokes to <option> elements by forwarding
   the detections to the parent <select> element.
 * Fixed obscured element detection in IE for elements in frames.
 * Added support for extension capabilites starting with "test:" in IE. This
   is basically to support the web-platform-tests WebDriver test suite. Adding
   an extension capability with name starting with "test:" will allow a user
   to create a session, but will have no effect on the session. It is a no-op.
 * Added IsFocusable method to IE driver Element class.
 * Added Protected Mode boundary crossing detection mechanism in IE. When a
   Protected Mode boundary is crossed by navigation (entering or exiting
   Protected Mode), the existing browser instance is destroyed and a new one
   created in its place by Interent Explorer. This commit adds detection for
   when a browser instance is being closed, but without an explicit call to
   the WebDriver close() or quit() methods. When this is detected, it's likely
   a Protected Mode boundary is being crossed, and all subsequent commands in
   the WebDriver session will fail. In this case, the driver will now write
   to the log that the browser has been asked to exit without the user
   explicitly requesting it. The detection is not perfect, since it's
   possible to legitimately click a link that closes the browser window, and
   this is indistinguishable from clicking a link that navigates to a URL
   that causes a Protected Mode boundary crossing. Nevertheless, this logging
   is being added so that users can see what may be happening when they
   receive errors like "Unable to get current browser."

v3.11.1.0
=========
 * Updated all C++ projects for the IE driver to use the Windows 8.1 SDK.
   This has the unfortunate side effect that the driver executable will no
   longer launch on Windows XP.
 * Removed direct call to InternetGetCookieEx2 API. Versions of IE prior to
   11 do not have access to this API. Linking directly to it via the Windows
   8.1 SDK creates an import entry in the IEDriver.dll library used by the
   driver. So that the driver can continue to be used against earlier releases,
   we will call the API using GetModuleHandle and GetProcAddress only if it
   exists in the version of WinINet being used by the browser. Fixes issue #5603.
 * Properly initializing JSON values in IE driver. Fixes issue #5519.

v3.11.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Added additional logging to new session command.
 * Added detection of intercepted element clicks to IE. This brings the IE
   driver into alignment with the Chrome and Firefox (geckodriver) drivers,
   in that it detects when an element attempting to be clicked on is covered
   in the z-order by another element. Do note that this may cause different
   behavior from previous versions of the IE driver for WebDriver code that
   runs only on IE. For code that runs cross-browser, this should now yield 
   the same behavior across platforms.


v3.10.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixed clear element command to handle cases where the element's parent
   document is undefined.
 * Fixed sending keystrokes with native events disabled. Because apparently,
   the driver's developer can't remember how function binding works in C++
   when using a pointer to the object instead of the object itself. Fixes
   issue #5584.

v3.10.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updated clear element command handler to return W3C compliant errors for IE.
 * Updated IE error response to be spec compliant for sendKeys
 * Fixed IE cookie retrieval for IE 10 and 11. Internet Explorer relies on a
   Windows component called WinINet to communicate over the Internet. This
   includes WinINet APIs for getting and setting cookies. Prior to Windows 10,
   persistent cookies were stored in files on the hard drive. A change in
   WinINet moved the persistent cookie storage from files on the disk to an
   Extensible Storage Engine (ESE or "Jet Blue") database, which rendered them
   unreadable by the IE driver. This commit restores the functionality of
   getting cookies by using an API function called InternetGetCookieEx2.

   This API function was introduced in the Windows 8.1 SDK, which means that
   it won't be available to older versions of WinINet. In that case, we fall
   back to the original behavior of attempting to parse cookie files from the
   disk. There is a chance that the detection of the availability of this API
   is flawed in the IE driver.
 * Revamped handling of modifier keys. The IE driver is now able to
   distinguish between the left and right modifier keys (Shift, Control,
   Alt) on the keyboard.
 * Modified mouse event handling to match W3C Specification.

   THIS IS A POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE.

   The simulation of mouse movement for the actions command now conforms
   to the W3C WebDriver Specification for mouse movement. This means
   that offsets in elements are now measured from the center of the
   element instead of the top-left, which was the previous behavior.
   Additionally, attempting to move the mouse pointer outside the
   browser view port will result in a "mouse movement out of bounds"
   error. While users should be aware that this might cause code
   using user interactions to fail, not that the behavior is now
   consistent with the behavior outlined in the specification, and
   the behavior of geckodriver in particular.
 * Modified processing of pause actions in keyboard action sequences.
   The vast majority of use of pause actions in a keyboard action
   sequence are used to synchronize the entire action chain with other
   (mouse) action sequences. To allow the driver to properly synchronize
   the input sequences, the driver will now ignore the duration property
   of pause events in keyboard action sequences. This is deliberately in
   violation of the W3C specification, and may be revisited in the future.
 * Fixed sending keystrokes outside the Basic Multilingual Plane. This
   allows emoji and other Unicode characters that are represented by
   surrogate pairs in UTF-16 to be sent to IE.
 * Fixed getElementProperty to return proper data type. Previously,
   the getElementProperty command would coerce the property value to a
   string. This is not correct behavior as specified in the W3C spec.
 * Revert behavior of user prompts appearing during JavaScript execution.
   This behavior causes too many problems in too many scenarios where a
   prompt can appear. Reverting to the previous behavior, which is that
   encountering a user prompt ('alert', 'confirm', 'prompt') when calling
   JavaScript with executeScript will immediately return control back to
   the WebDriver code (returning null), and rely on the immediately
   following command to handle the user prompt.

v3.10.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v3.9.0.4
========
 * Fixed behavior for user prompts appearing during JavaScript execution.
   The W3C WebDriver Specification states that when performing the
   executeScript or executeAsyncScript commands, if the script brings up
   a user prompt ('alert', 'confirm', or 'prompt'), the user prompt handler
   should be invoked immediately, and the proper notification (if any) be
   sent as the response to the command. Previously, the user prompt handler
   would not be invoked until the next command.
 * Updated get active element command in IE to handle missing body element.
   This change is required to make the driver compliant with the W3C WebDriver
   Specification.
 * Changed new session command in IE to allow empty timeouts list. This change
   is required to make the driver compliant with the W3C WebDriver
   Specification.
 * Fixed IE driver element detection for user-executed JavaScript. This commit
   fixes a corner case where elements added to the known element repository
   via non-JavaScript means were not being properly detected when the same
   element was located via user-executed JavaScript. We now properly sync up
   the element repository once the user's JavaScript has completed.

v3.9.0.3
========
 * Refactored user input simulation code in IE driver. This commit breaks out
   the three modes of user input simulation (native events using SendMessage,
   native events using SendInput, simulated events using JavaScript) into
   separate classes, making it easier to debug. Additionally, this commit
   removes the code for enabling persistent hovers. This code had been
   inadvertently disabled in a separate refactor some months ago, and there
   have been no issue reports in that area, leading the IE driver development
   team to believe that the issue in IE that required persistent hovers has
   been resolved (at least in IE11). The code for persistent hovers has been
   retained in a new, separate class in the project, but this class is not
   built as part of the IE driver at this time. If issue reports warrent
   its inclusion in the future, it can be easily re-added.
 * Added support allowing binding to IPv6 loopback in IE driver. When no host
   is specified on the command line, and no list of whitelisted IP addresses
   are specified, IEDriverServer.exe will now bind to both the IPv4 and IPv6
   loopback adapters. If no IPv6 stack is found on the OS, the executable
   will retry binding only to IPv4. Note that when using whitelisted IP
   addresses, only IPv4 is supported. This is a limitation of the Civetweb
   HTTP server upon which IEDriverServer.exe relies. This commit also updates
   the version of Civetweb to 1.10.

v3.9.0.2
========
 * Reduced overall wait interval time.
 * Shortened IE sleep interval looping for JavaScript execution completion.
   This prevents excessively long delays for Selenium commands executed via
   executeScript, like submit(), isDisplayed(), or getAttribute(). Partially
   fixes issue #5024.
 * Moved double-click detection logic inside InputManager for IE. This also
   will prevents unnecessary expensive sleeps in the click command handler.
   Partially fixes issue #5024.
 * Updated to better handle non-US keyboards in sendKeys. In the transition
   to support the W3C specification, using sendKeys on non-US keyboard layouts
   got broken. This is an attempt to resolve that issue. Previously, we were
   only checking a high-order byte for the need to press the shift key, and 
   not other modifier keys (control or alt) in sending keystrokes. This
   behavior has been restored. Fixes issue #4253.

v3.9.0.1
========
 * Made JavaScript execution asynchronous for executeScript in IE.

   Prior to this change, the execution of JavaScript via the executeScript
   method was synchronous. This would mean that if the script passed into the
   driver called the JavaScript `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()`
   functions, the WebDriver code would hang until the dialog was manually
   dismissed. Moving this to asynchronous execution allows the driver to be
   compliant with the W3C WebDriver Specification, that mandates that user
   prompts triggered by executeScript should be able to be handled by the
   WebDriver alert handling functions. However, this spec compliance comes at
   several costs.

   The first cost is complexity. The IE driver uses COM interfaces to
   communicate with Internet Explorer. COM is inherently single-threaded, and
   requires a fair amount of manipulation to allow accessing the objects on
   separate threads. This leads to requiring a fairly complex system of
   communication and synchronization between the threads to give the illusion
   of a synchronous script execution.

   The second cost is performance. Because of the need for synchronization,
   this change **may** introduce a performance hit in the IE driver. This is
   unfortunate, but unavoidable. The benefit of having user-initiated
   JavaScript not block and hang WebDriver code far outweighs whatever
   relatively small performance hit has been introduced.

   Finally, there is every chance that, despite all efforts to the contrary,
   it's possible that there are new regressions introduced by this change.
   Multiple test suites have been run using this change, and none have
   failed thus far due to the changes herein. Claims that this change is
   causing a specific failure should be accompanied by a full test case, or
   issues reported against this change will be summarily closed.

v3.9.0.0
========
 * Refactor IE user-initiated JavaScript execution to use JSON objects.
   This IE driver refactor is internal, but should not change behavior of the
   driver. It is intended to let the driver's internal script executor use
   the direct internal JSON objects as arguments for script execution,
   deferring their conversion into variants until directly before execution.
 * Removed clearing of known element cache on document navigation. This
   was causing incorrect NoSuchElementException when
   StaleElementReferenceException was expected.
 * Updated IE driver alert detection to get alert text from "repeat" alerts.
   This commit should allow the proper retrieval of alert text from IE alerts
   that happen "repeatedly." That is, those that have the checkbox stating
   "Do not let this page create any more alerts." Unlike standard Windows
   alerts, these use controls that are only available via Active
   Accessibility to retrieve the text. The driver now is able to detect and
   retrieve text from these types of alerts.
 * Removed now-deprecated non-standard tr1 namespace.
 * (on behalf of Jacob Kiesel) Modified to use a mutex to lock Win32 message
   handling. Fixes issue #5304.

v3.8.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v3.7.0.1
========
 * Updated IE setAlertText command to check for invalid data.
 * Updated getActiveElement command for IE driver to handle contentEditable
   elements.
 * Fixed IE driver setTimeouts command to properly validate JSON payload.
 * Updated IE driver new session command handler to process null capability
   values.
 * Updated IE driver getActiveElement command to be spec-compliant. If there
   is no active element, this method may now return a null results, as in
   compliance with the W3C WebDriver specification, which relies on the DOM
   definition of active element. Language bindings maintainers should
   take note that this is a behavior change, and that the command can now
   return null values. Adjust your language bindings accordingly.
 * Made IE driver SetWindowRect command compliant with spec.
 * Made commands return NoSuchElement error in IE with incorrect internal IDs.
   The IE driver, to be spec compliant, must return "no such element" if an
   invalid internal WebDriver ID is passed in the URL. Previously, the driver
   would assume that the ID was one that was previously provided by the
   driver, but now has gone stale. This may cause discomfort for some rare
   use cases where the incorrect exception is being looked for.
 * Updating IE driver element tag name command handler to be spec compliant

v3.7.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v3.6.0.1
========
 * Updated existing command to better follow the W3C WebDriver Specification.
   In particular, aligned certain HTTP response codes to be returned from
   the driver, added initial timeout values for timeouts, updated new session
   payload processing, updated navigation to URL, and updated finding of
   elements all to comply with spec behavior.
 * Updated proxy processing to properly support `direct` value.
   Fixes issue #4981.
 * Updated action processing to correctly handle carriage return ('\r')
   characters in sendKeys.

v3.6.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v3.5.1.1
========
 * Updated to better support W3C WebDriver Specification. This is a large
   update that includes implementation of the following things that are part
   of the WebDriver spec:
   * Implement the "get element property" command
   * Implement the "get named cookie" command
   * Implement the "minimize window" command
   * Implement the "fullscreen window" command
   * Update "set window rect" command to correctly recognize and restore 
    from minimized or full screen state
   * Fix the "release actions" command to properly roll back all pending
    actions
   * Update the "perform actions" command to be more robust for pointer
    actions
   * Fix alert handling to handle dialogs with the "Do not show any more
    dialogs" check box
   * Added handling for the "dismiss and notify" and "accept and notify"
    user prompt handler states
   * Updated proxy handling to more closely align with the spec language

v3.5.1.0
========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updated IE driver atoms to properly return element position. A recent
   update to the Closure compiler caused a regression in the IE driver as
   it was more aggressive about renaming properties of objects returned
   from JavaScript functions than previous versions. This release adds a
   custom IE-only atom that avoids this behavior of the compiler, and lets
   the driver properly return an element's location. Fixes issue #4480.

v3.5.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * To successfully use this version of the IE driver, you should be using
   version 3.5 or above of the language bindings. Those are the only versions
   of language bindings that will understand the payload required to be sent
   during the creation of a new session. Earlier versions of the language
   bindings are not guaranteed to be fully compatible with this release of
   the IE driver.

v3.4.0.1
========
 * This release adds the remote protocol end points and handling of commands
   as required by the W3C WebDriver Specification for the IE driver. It
   deprecates and mostly removes behavior that is at odds with the
   specification, but may have been the proper behavior under the open-source
   dialect of the protocol. Issues arising from this version of the driver
   that appeared to work in previous versions will only be addressed if a
   simple test case is provided that demonstrates it working in a prior
   version of the driver and failing in this one. Reported issues lacking
   such a test case will be summarily closed.

v3.4.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v3.3.0.3
========
 * The IE file upload dialog may not be a direct child of the IE window.
   This has become very clear in testing the previous rewrite of the file
   upload dialog handling code. This version fixes that problem, and should
   now correctly find the dialog, even if it isn't directly a child of the
   top-level IE frame window.

v3.3.0.2
========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Rewriting file upload dialog handling code. Previously, the IE driver
   would use simple window handling and Windows APIs to find and manipulate
   the IE file selection dialog for the file upload case. With this change,
   the driver now uses the Windows UI Automation library that ships as part
   of the Windows operating system to detect and manipulate the dialog.
   Unfortunately, since handling native dialogs this way is highly OS-
   dependent, there may be changes in behavior based on different versions
   of Windows, or different versions of IE. At the moment, this change
   has been tested against Windows 10, and IE 11. Other versions may not
   work exactly the same. Temporarily, to retain backward compatibility,
   it's possible to use the legacy handling with the file upload dialog
   box. This can be set by setting a capability of
   "ie.useLegacyFileUploadDialogHandling" to true. This capability is only
   intended to be provided temporarily, and will be removed as soon as is
   practical. As such, the capability is not documented, and its presence
   should not be relied on over the long term. It should be pointed out
   that, as has been the case since July 2016, the driver now only supports
   IE versions 9, 10, and 11, and only supports Windows Vista and above.

v3.3.0.1
========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Implementing IE driver custom capabilities in sub-object. As of this 
   version, all IE-only capabilities should be put in a JSON object and
   that object assigned to a property named "se:ieOptions" in the
   capabilities object passed to the driver when starting a new session.
   The only top-level capabilities that the driver will now recognize are
   "browserName", "unexpectedAlertBehaviour", "pageLoadStrategy", and
   "proxy". As has always been the case, with the IE driver unknown
   capability names will be ignored. For the moment, this change is backward
   compatible with language bindings that do not use the new capability
   format, but this will change in the future, and IE-only capabilities that
   are set at the top level of the capabilities object (i.e., not in a
   sub-object that is the value of a property named "se:ieOptions") will
   eventually be ignored.

v3.3.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v3.2.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v3.1.0.1
========
 * Code reorganization and cleanup, mostly reorganizing header files.
 * Removing support for the Microsoft IE driver implementation. This
   implementation has been entirely abandoned by Microsoft, and is
   unlikely to ever receive more attention.

v3.1.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v3.0.0.0
========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.53.1.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fall back to using browser instead of document to get current URL. To 
   maintain compatibility with other WebDriver implementations, the IE
   driver uses the IHTMLDocument2 interface to get the current URL, so
   that the proper URL is returned even when an embedded frame has the
   focus. However, when browsing a non-HTML document (like a PDF), the
   driver cannot get an IHTMLDocument2. In that case, fall back to the
   IWebBrowser2 interface.

v2.53.1.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms, including update to wgxpath.
 * IE driver no longer returns proxy capability unless a proxy is requested.

v2.53.0.1
=========
 * Modified wait algorithm to respect page load strategy for 
   IWebBrowser2::ReadyState. Prior to this commit, the driver would only
   respect the page load strategy for document.readyState, not for the
   browser COM object. This means that, for example, when IE has an info
   bar being displayed (like when downloading a file), the driver will wait
   indefinitely, since the IWebBrowser2 object's ReadyState property will
   never cycle over to "complete," topping out at "interactive." Fixes issues
   #999 and #1843.

v2.53.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * (on behalf of Nathan Isom) Fixed spelling in IE driver registry path 
   for use in error messages.

v2.52.2.0
=========
 * Updated IE driver to not error on findElements JavaScript atom errors.
   Hitting a JavaScript error with the atom is an unrecoverable error. The
   most common case of this for IE is when there is a page refresh,
   navigation, or similar, and the driver is polling for element presence.
   The calling code can't do anything about it, so we might as well just log
   and return success with an empty list. This was fixed in 2.52.1 for the
   "find single element" case, but was not completely fixed for the "find
   multiple elements" case. As before, this is an extreme hack, and has the
   potential to be masking a very serious problem in the driver.

v2.52.1.1
=========
 * Updated JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added logging of found dialog window handle for file upload dialog.

v2.52.1.0
=========
 * Updated JavaScript automation atoms, including update to wgxpath library.
 * Updated IE driver to return NoSuchElement on JavaScript atom errors.
   Hitting a JavaScript error with the atom is an unrecoverable error. The
   most common case of this for IE is when there is a page refresh,
   navigation, or similar, and the driver is polling for element presence.
   The calling code can't do anything about it, so we might as well just log
   and return "no such element" error code. In the common case, this means
   that the error will be transitory, and will sort itself out once the DOM
   returns to normal after the page transition is completed. Note carefully
   that this is an extreme hack, and has the potential to be masking a very
   serious problem in the driver.
 * Bumped IE default file upload dialog timoeut to 3000ms.
 
v2.52.0.1
=========
 * Removing IE driver support for ie.validateCookieDocumentType capability.
   This capability was made obsolete with the rewrite of the IE driver's
   cookie handling in 2.47. It has been ignored since, so this commit removes
   the IE driver code for that capability.
 * Make IE driver directly return capabilities from new session command.
   Previously, the driver would return a redirect HTTP response (303), and
   the language bindings were expected to follow the redirect to get the
   returned capabilities. This has been an obsolete pattern for some time,
   and the IE driver is only now conforming to the proper pattern of simply
   returning a 200 response with the correct capabilities as part of the
   body.
 * Updating logic for uploading files in IE. Updating the IE driver's handling
   of sendKeys to have extra logging around finding the file open dialog. Also
   rearranged the search for the dialog to more properly find the dialog using
   the most common method first.

v2.52.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * (on behalf of Anton Usmansky) Added ie.enableFullPageScreenshot capability
   to allow users to create screenshots of only the current view port. The
   capability defaults to true, which preserves the original behavior of 
   resizing the browser window and taking a screenshot of the full page.

v2.51.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.50.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.49.0.2
=========
 * Fixed finding elements where native CSS selector engine cannot be found.

v2.49.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Changes to simplify the execution of finding elements. The driver now
   delegates more of the error handling of finding elements to the JavaScript
   automation atoms. This has the effect of simplifying the code within the
   driver, and synchronizes the error-case behavior with other implementations.

v2.49.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.48.0.5
=========
 * Refactoring of IE driver native events interaction code. This commit
   removes the dependency on shared native event code with Firefox.
   Since Firefox no longer supports native events, it makes no sense to
   have common code refactored for only one consumer, so this commit
   moves the Windows-only SendMessage code directly into the IE driver.
   This is a first step toward deleting the webdriver-interactions
   directory. While extreme care has been taken to ensure this
   refactoring causes no regressions, there is a chance something will
   still break. This particular refactor should also be treated as an
   intermediate step, as the ported code contains some redundancies to
   what is already present in the driver. Future refactoring will take
   place to remove the redundancies and better integrate the code.

v2.48.0.4
=========
 * Added ability to set whitelisted IP addresses to access IE driver server.
   The list of IP addresses is a comma-delimited list passed to the
   /whitelisted-ips command-line argument. Defaults to local loopback address
   only. Also improved logging to show executable version and architecture in
   driver log. Patch provided by lsowen.

v2.48.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modifications to file upload functionality. Added additional logging
   to help diagnose issues where the file selection dialog is not closed
   by the driver. Also added a new capability, ie.fileUploadDialogTimeout
   to allow users to customize the amount of time the driver waits for
   the file selection dialog before giving up. It defaults to one second.
   Finally, the driver now checks that the file exists before sending the
   file name to the file selection dialog. If the file does not exist,
   the sendKeys method will throw an exception explicitly stating that
   the file does not exist.

v2.48.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Includes fix for clearing input elements with type "number".

v2.48.0.1
=========
 * Updating to return top-level URL when focused on a frame. This makes the
   driver now consistent with other implementations.

v2.48.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.47.0.5
=========
 * Updating screenshot code to retain scroll bars in required directions.
   When an IE window needs to be resized to obtain the full-DOM screenshot,
   if it has scroll bars in either direction, those scroll bars need to be
   present in the resized window, so that layout recalculation doesn't occur.
   In practice, this means reducing the window size by 2 pixels in the
   appropriate direction before taking the screenshot. The resulting scroll
   bars are cropped from the image.

v2.47.0.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updating screenshot code to prevent resizing if window is large enough.
   In the previous screenshot update, the driver would incorrectly resize
   the IE window smaller if the document was smaller in height or width
   than the current window size. This could cause redraws of the page
   being viewed such that after resizing, the screenshot still did not
   display the entire page. This commit resolves that issue, and also takes
   into account the size of the scroll bars when creating the screenshot
   image. NOTE: There is a *very* slight chance that resizing the window
   so there are no longer scroll bars to be displayed *might* still cause
   layout redraws such that the screenshot does not show the entire DOM
   after the resize. Since we should now always be expanding the window size,
   never contracting it, this is a corner case that explicitly will *not* be
   fixed. Any issue reports describing this corner case will be closed without
   action. Fixes issue #1085.

v2.47.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Removed use of Windows hooks for taking screenshots in IE. This will fix
   the issue of taking full-page screenshots when using the 32-bit IE driver
   on 64-bit Windows installations.

v2.47.0.2
=========
 * Corrected build process to create executables runnable on Windows XP.

v2.47.0.1
=========
 * Added logging messages for IE driver for bitness mismatches. This commit
   adds logging messages at the warning level whenever a mismatch in bitness
   is detected between the browser and driver. This is a particularly bad
   problem in cases where users have 64-bit Windows, and (incorrectly) assume
   they automatically should use the 64-bit IEDriverServer.exe when running
   with IE 10 or 11. Since the process that actually renders content in IE 10
   and 11 is almost always 32-bit, even on 64-bit Windows, it is almost always
   the proper decision to use the 32-bit IE driver. It is now very clear from
   log messages when this state of affairs exists.
 * Enabled fast failure for cookie manipulation in IE. The refactor of cookie
   handling for the IE driver introduces an incompatibility with the 64-bit IE
   driver and IE 10 and 11 running on 64-bit Windows. As is the case with
   sending keystrokes and creating screenshots, a Windows hook procedure is now
   used for getting and settingcookies in IE. That means that in IE 10 and 11
   on 64-bit Windows, where the content rendering process is still 32-bit, you
   **must** use the 32-bit IEDriverServer.exe in order to manipulate cookies.
   This commit will now cause exceptions to be thrown if you attempt to set
   or get cookies using the 64-bit driver against a 32-bit version of IE (or
   vice versa), but in particular, this will affect users who mistakenly try
   to use the 64-bit executable with IE 10 or 11 in 64-bit Windows.

v2.47.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.46.0.12
==========
 * Fixed handling of authentication dialogs for different Windows versions.

v2.46.0.11
==========
 * Enabling handling of authentication dialogs in IE driver.
 * Modified to resize IE window for screenshots using dimensions of top-level
   document when focused on a frame. Fixes issue #703.

v2.46.0.10
==========
 * Init last known mouse position with -1, -1. This avoids issues where the
   first operation is to move the mouse to [0, 0]. Patch provided by Anton
   Usmansky.

v2.46.0.9
=========
 * Fixed bug in SOCKS proxy authentication settings retrieval.

v2.46.0.8
=========
 * Fixed bug in screenshot handling due to Windows hook refactor.

v2.46.0.7
=========
 * Fixed cookie delete bug for related domains.

v2.46.0.6
=========
 * Corrected cookie add/delete logic with respect to HTTP-only cookies.

v2.46.0.5
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updated delete cookie logic to no longer rely on JavaScript. This allows
   HTTP-only cookies to be deleted by the driver.
 * Added support for SOCKS proxy in the IE driver. Using a SOCKS proxy is not
   quite as straightforward for IE as it is for other browser drivers. While
   the driver is now able to set the proxy settings for a SOCKS proxy, using
   the ie.usePerProcessProxy capability with a user name and password for a
   SOCKS proxy is problematic for the driver. The Windows API does not provide
   any ability to set the user name and password for a SOCKS proxy on a
   per-process basis. The driver attempts to work around this limitation, but
   this combination will be largely unsupported. Using the driver to temporarily
   set the global proxy settings on the machine should work as normal.

v2.46.0.4
=========
 * Corrected logic for http-only and secure cookies. Cookies now behave
   in IE as expected. The driver will properly return 'secure' or
   'httpOnly' flags as set on the cookie itself. Note carefully that
   'secure' cookies will only be retrieved when browsing a page using
   SSL (https), as this is the only environment where the cookies are
   used by the browser. This behavior is consistent with the behavior
   of the Chrome driver, and with the W3C specification behavior for
   cookies. Firefox, it should be noted, returns secure cookies regardless
   of whether the page in question is being browsed via SSL or not.
   This is a bug in the Firefox driver.

v2.46.0.3
=========
 * Fixed IE cookie handling for down-level operating systems.

v2.46.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Refactoring Windows Hooks. Windows hooks are now wrapped in a single class,
   eliminating a fair amount of duplicate code.
 * Rewrote cookie handling for IE. The IE driver should now be able to return
   full information for most cookies, including expiration date and secure
   status. Additionally, the driver will now return HTTP-only cookies from
   IE. Note that some specific cookie information will still be incomplete.
   In particular, session cookies that may have been set with domain, path,
   or secure tokens in the cookie string will not have those tokens set in
   the returned cookie, as that information is not available via any API.
   Also note that this change introduces additional use of Windows APIs that
   are not supported when run from a service process, making that more
   completely unsupported. Fixes issue #391.

v2.46.0.1
=========
 * Handles issue with alert text controls conatining no accText property in IE.
   Fixes issue #651.

v2.46.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.45.0.6
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Allow IE driver to work with transparent file upload elements. Many modern
   JavaScript widget frameworks hide <input type="file"> elements so as to
   make their UIs "prettier." The IE driver would see these elements as not
   visible, and thus not interactible. This commit allows users to use sendKeys
   to upload files when this type of file upload element exists, bringing the
   driver in line with what is allowed by the Firefox driver.

v2.45.0.5
=========
 * Changed to allow interaction with elements where opacity = 0. The
   isDisplayed will still return false for those elements, as is consistent
   with drivers for Firefox and Chrome. Fixes issue #503.

v2.45.0.4
=========
 * Added busy check after attaching to newly launched IE instance.
 * Corrected logic in 'eager' page loading strategy for IE.

v2.45.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Corrected wrong value for pageLoadStrategy capability.
 * Reset browser window handle on failure to attach via Active Accessibility.
   When launching a new instance, if the driver attempts to use Active
   Accessibility to attach to the instance, and the attach fails, the driver
   should attempt to attach using the ShellWindows API. However, this fallback
   is skipped if the window has already been found. Resetting the found window
   handle to NULL allows the driver to proceed with the second attempt.

v2.45.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added pageLoadStrategy to IE driver. Setting a capability named 
   pageLoadStrategy when creating a session with the IE driver will now change
   the wait behavior when navigating to a new page. The valid values are:

    "normal" - Waits for document.readyState to be 'complete'. This is the
            default, and is the same behavior as all previous versions of
            the IE driver.
    "eager"  - Will abort the wait when document.readyState is
            'interactive' instead of waiting for 'complete'.
    "none"   - Will abort the wait immediately, without waiting for any of
            the page to load.

   Setting the capability to an invalid value will result in use of the
   "normal" page load strategy.
 * Added delay and logging on attaching to launched IE. There are times when
   the two methods used for attaching to a launched instance of Internet
   Explorer will fail. This commit adds additional logging to help make
   diagnosing the exact failure points of these circumstances easier.

v2.45.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Changed to prevent crash when driver fails to connect to IWebBrowser2
   object.

v2.45.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.44.0.4
=========
 * Fixed passing per-process proxy settings to new windows. Fixes issue #8112.

v2.44.0.3
=========
 * Fixed finding elements by XPath for IE 9 where document mode is less than
   IE9.

v2.44.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added additional logging to cache clearing code
 * Updated session intialization to more robustly handle malformed JSON.
   Previously, in the IE driver, malformed JSON requests when requesting a
   new session would cause the driver to crash. The new behavior is that
   if the JSON payload for the new session is malformed by not including
   a desiredCapabilities object will now throw an exception. If the user
   passes a capability value with the wrong data type, it will be logged
   by the driver at a warning level, and the default value for the specified
   capability will be used.

v2.44.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Introduced capability to disable check of document type when setting
   cookies. When setting cookies, there is a check in the IE driver to validate
   that the page in the browser is, in fact, an HTML page. Despite the fact
   that omitting this check can cause unrecoverable crashes in the driver,
   there is demand for a mechanism to disable this check for older, legacy
   versions of Internet Explorer. This commit introduces a new capability,
   "ie.validateCookieDocumentType" which, when set to false, skips this check
   when adding a cookie. The default for this capability when unspecified for
   a session is true; users setting this capability to false are considered to
   be on their own when encountering issues setting cookies, including, but not
   limited to, crashes in the driver executable. Fixes issue #1227.

v2.44.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.43.0.2
=========
 * Implemented retrival of alert text for onBeforeUnload dialogs. Fixes issue
   #7901.

v2.43.0.1
=========
 * Improved cross-platform compatibility of webdriver-server C++ code. This
   commit makes the common webdriver-server C++ code more easily cross-
   platform. It does this mainly by removing use of std::tr1::regex, which has
   issues compiling under gcc. In its place, we now use a custom URL matching
   algorithm for matching URLs in the WebDriver JSON Wire Protocol. While this
   matching algorithm may be a potential source of future errors, a nice side
   effect of it is a 3% performance increase in server execution times over
   using regular expressions. Additionally, this commit includes an alias for
   snprintf, which throws buffer overrun warnings when used with Visual Studio.
   It also contains some header #include rearranging and linting of the C++
   code.
 * Implemented driver implementation autodetect in IE driver server. When
   specified by the correct command line switch, the driver will use the
   Microsoft driver implementation, if the detected version of IE is 11 or
   higher, and if the implementation is installed. Otherwise, it will fall
   back to the legacy (open-source) implementation.
 * Updated third-party C++ library dependencies. This resolves compiler
   warnings when compiling Civetweb and JsonCpp under Visual Studio.

v2.43.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Integrated the Microsoft Internet Explorer driver implementation.

   This commit optionally allows the user to use the Microsoft-supplied
   implementation of WebDriver for IE 11 and above. To use the Microsoft
   implementation, the user must have the August 2014 updates to Internet
   Explorer installed through Windows Update, and must install the IE Web
   Driver Tool for Internet Explorer 11 download from Microsoft
   (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44069).

   Once those prerequisites are installed, the user can use the
   InternetExplorerDriverService object in the language bindings to set the
   implementation to be used.

   By default, the driver will continue to use the driver implementation
   developed by the open-source project. Over time as the Microsoft
   implementation matures, this will be switched to use that implementation,
   first by default, then exclusively.
 * Fixed IEDriver crash in WaitUntilElementFocused() because of null pointer.
   Added required null check after document->get_activeElement() call
   (see MSDN documentation for more information). Fixes issue #7577. Patch 
   provided by Dominik Rauch.

v2.42.0.2
=========
 * Updated json-cpp lib and replaced mongoose web server with civetweb. The
   Mongoose project has changed its licensing to GPL. This change replaces
   Mongoose with Civetweb, a fork of the Mongoose project at the last commit
   under the previous license. Civetweb is licensed using the MIT license.
   Additionally, the JsonCpp project has moved and changed owners. It now has
   a much simpler method of source code incorporation into additional projects.
   See the README.txt in third_party/json-cpp for information about how to
   generate the code included here.

v2.42.0.1
=========
 * Implemented switchToParentFrame command.

v2.42.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.41.0.2
=========
 * Fixed IE driver to allow JavaScript objects with property names with spaces.
   Fixes issue #7305.

v2.41.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixed crash when clicking on link that opens a new window.
   When IWebBrowser2::Quit() is called, the wrapper process doesn't exit
   right away. When that happens, CoCreateInstance can fail while the abandoned
   iexplore.exe instance is still valid. The "right" way to do this would be to
   call ::EnumProcesses before calling CoCreateInstance, finding all of the
   iexplore.exe processes, waiting for one to exit, and then proceed. However,
   there is no way to tell if a process ID belongs to an Internet Explorer
   instance, particularly when a 32-bit process tries to enumerate 64-bit
   processes on 64-bit Windows. So, we take the brute force way out, just
   retrying the call to CoCreateInstance until it succeeds (the old
   iexplore.exe process has exited), or we get a different error code. We also
   set a 45-second timeout, with 45 seconds being chosen because it's below the
   default 60 second HTTP request timeout of most language bindings. Fixes
   issue #5848. Fixes issue #7021.

v2.41.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.40.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.39.0.7
=========
 * Improved error message for findElements in the failure case.
 * Added additional logging for failure of get_mimeType when setting cookies.
 * Fixed edge case for finding elements by class name with invalid characters.
   The fix should be isolated only to situations where the IE document mode
   is 8 or less. In other words, it should fix the case for quirks mode for
   IE9 or below, and for standards mode for IE8 or below.

v2.39.0.6
=========
 * Reorganized wait algorithm in HtmlDialog. Now is more correctly aborting
   the wait if a new (cascading) dialog is detected. Fixes issue #6744.

v2.39.0.5
=========
 * Modified to use bot.dom.getOverflowState atom for element overflow. This
   is a more reliable and fully tested method than previously used. There is
   still a minor issue when the element point in question is exactly on the
   overflow border, but this needs to be addressed in the atoms code, rather
   than at the IE driver level. Fixes issue #6898.   

v2.39.0.4
=========
 * Update call of isDisplayed atom in IE to not ignore opacity. Previously,
   the driver explicitly ignored opacity for IE, but now takes it into account.
   Fixes issue #6827.

v2.39.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Attempted fix for finding multiple elements with invalid CSS selectors.

v2.39.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * On behalf of Mark Watson: Added ability to attach to IE using the
   ShellWindows API instead of the ActiveAccessibility API. This is useful
   when the Windows global atoms table is exhausted. Fixes issue #5342.

v2.39.0.1
=========
 * Improved error message for failed launch of IE using IELaunchURL API.
   We now translate the HRESULT received from the API into a text error
   message.

v2.39.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.38.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.37.0.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixed crash encountered when taking screenshot of non-HTML page. This does
   not throw an error, but fails silently, with no screenshot being generated.
   Fixes issue #6576.

v2.37.0.3
=========
 * Refactored detection of single-text-node child elements in IE. In IE, a
   containing text and no background color will not register as a hit target
   unless the mouse cursor is directly over the text of the element. However,
   in the case of block elements with children that include text nodes in
   addition to other elements, if the first text node does not contain any
   text, the correct behavior is to use the center of the block element for
   mouse movements. This commit corrects that behavior.

v2.37.0.2
=========
 * Refactored notification of new showModalDialog windows. Previously, the
   code notifying the command executor of new HTML dialog windows (opened by
   the showModalDialog function) would not always fire in the case where a
   second modal was opened from a first. We now notify of the existence of
   the new modal whenever a modal is found. This has the potential to cause
   mild performance degredation in the modal dialog case, but this is a small
   price to pay for the correctness of the driver. Fixes issue #6416.

v2.37.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified detection of HTML page. The method for retrieving the expected
   type description for HTML pages was far more complex than it needed to be.
   We now use the AssocQueryString API instead of trying to read the registry. 

v2.37.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.36.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.35.3.5
=========
 * Fixed bug in getting element location.

v2.35.3.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added padding for IE < 8 for getting invisible element location. Invisible
   elements on IE 6 and 7 have a 2-pixel border that must be added.

v2.35.3.3
=========
 * Fixed HTML dialog logic for self-closing documents. HTML dialog windows
   opened using showModalDialog() have no way to properly notify of their
   closing. The IE driver attempts to detect closing of these windows by
   listening for user-initiated actions, either by calling the WebDriver close
   method, or clicking on an element that causes the dialog to close. This
   commit adds logic to the method used for getting all window handles to
   validate the existence of any HTML dialog windows, properly notifying the
   driver if the OS-level window handle is no longer valid. Fixes issue #6249.
 * Fixed HTML dialog logic for redirected documents. Getting the parent window
   of an HTML dialog's document can fail, especially if the document changed
   out from under us before we could get the window reference. The canonical
   case for this is a redirect using JavaScript. Now we will sleep for a short
   time, then retry to obtain the reference to the window object. Fixes issue
   #6224.

v2.35.3.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Adding more accurate logging during waiting for browser navigation to
   complete.

v2.35.3.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixed problem getting SVG elements in IE9 and above.

v2.35.3.0
=========
 * Version number change only for public release to downloads page.

v2.35.2.1
=========
 * Take document mode into account when getting size of view port for element
   clicks.

v2.35.2.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Refactored calculations to the size of the visible view port. There are
   circumstances where IE can have no vertical scroll bar. In these cases, the
   IE driver would assume there was a vertical scroll bar, which would make the
   actual width of the document larger than the computed width of the window.
   This, in turn, would make the driver assume there was a horizontal scroll
   bar, which would imply that absolutely-positioned elements at the bottom of
   the page would not be seen as clickable.
 * Modified to ignore frames which can not be retrieved by
   IHTMLFramesCollection2::item while waiting for page load complete. This
   change prevents infinite page load on IE9 for pages with frameset that do
   not specify column or row counts. Fixes issue #3211.

v2.35.1.0
=========
 * Updated to correct active element finding when using synthetic events. Fixes
   issue #6088.

v2.35.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Preventing crash in IE driver using synthetic events. In some cases
   document.activeElement returns an empty object rather than null. This could
   cause the IE driver to crash. This change fixes the crash, but not the
   underlying JavaScript atoms issue. This is handled by another commit. Fixes
   issue #6067.
 * Added PAC and proxy autodetect (WPAD) support to IEDriverServer.exe.

v2.34.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.33.0.10
==========
 * Fixed memory allocation in ProxyManager class to work correctly under
   Release builds.

v2.33.0.9
=========
 * Added error checking in DocumentHost::GetPageSource. Fixes issue #5967.
 * Removed StringUtilities methods to create strings from longs. The C++
   standard type libary already provides std::to_string() and std::to_wstring()
   for this purpose.
 * Introduced ability to clean browser cache before launching IE. This version
   introduces the ie.ensureCleanSession capability, which will clear the
   browser cache, history, and cookies before launching IE. When using this
   capability, be aware that this clears the cache for all running instances of
   Internet Explorer. Using this capability while attempting to run multiple
   instances of the IE driver may cause unexpected behavior. Note this also
   will cause a performance drop when launching the browser, as the driver will
   wait for the cache clearing process to complete before actually launching
   IE.
 * Refactored Proxy setting handling in IE driver. We no longer need to replace
   the window procedure to accomplish setting the proxy on a per-process basis,
   simplifying the process considerably. This version also modifies the
   ProxyManager class to let it build the proxy setting string instead of
   prebuilding it in the new session command handler. Finally, this version
   allows the proxy settings to be passed back to the language bindings via the
   return from the getSessionCapabilities command handler.

v2.33.0.8
=========
 * Added Proxy support to the IE driver native code. This commit adds proxy
   support to the native code of the IE driver, having it recognize the proxy
   capability in the WebDriver JSON wire protocol. The default behavior will
   change the system proxy when a new instance of the IE driver is created.
   This means that from that point forward, all IE instances, including those
   *not* started by WebDriver, will use the same proxy information. The driver
   will attempt to reset the system proxy to the previous settings when the 
   session is properly exited by use of the quit method. Be aware that this 
   means that crashes in the driver may leave the system's proxy settings in an
   inconsistent state, and it further implies that attempting to drive multiple
   instances of IE using proxy settings will likely do the same.
   
   The driver sets the proxy settings by means of the Windows WinINet API,
   which explicitly cannot be used from within a Windows service. This implies
   that IEDriverServer.exe cannot be used from within a Windows service.
   
   This commit also introduces a new capability, "ie.usePerProcessProxy". This
   capability takes a boolean value, and defaults to false. When set to true,
   it attempts to only set the proxy information for a single IE process, and
   does not affect the proxy settings of other instances of IE. Use of this 
   capability should be considered extremely experimental at present,and may
   cause IE to behave inconsistently when attempting to use a proxy with this
   capability set.

v2.33.0.7
=========
 * Refactored IE driver to take advantage of new StringUtilities methods.
 * Refactored BrowserFactory class to use member variables. Previously, most
   functionality was passed into the methods of the BrowserFactory, breaking
   the principle of encapsulation. This change also moves the ability to force
   the use of the Windows CreateProcess API and to pass command-line parameters
   to the CreateProcess API to capabilities of the IE driver, rather than
   arguments passed via the command line of IEDriverServer.exe.

v2.33.0.6
=========
 * Refactored IE driver registry access methods to RegistryUtilities class.
   This eliminates the need for an unnecessary extra instance of the
   BrowserFactory class.
 * Implemented logging for IE driver HtmlDialog class.
 * Cleaned up IEDriver logging on asynchronous script execution.

v2.33.0.5
=========
 * Corrected logic for invisible element coordinate calculation on IE6 and 7.

v2.33.0.4
=========
 * Reverting logic change for invisible element coordinate calculation on IE6
   and 7.

v2.33.0.3
=========
 * Corrected logic for invisible element coordinate calculation on IE6 and 7.
 * Fixed logic error in Script::ExecuteAsync() waiting for exclusive access to
   event.
 * Added IE-specific atoms to eliminate round-trips through IE's JS engine. The
   findElement and findElements atoms take a JavaScript object as their first
   parameter. Until now, that facilitated a round-trip through the IE
   JavaScript engine to be able to create the JavaScript object to pass into
   the atom function. We are now creating IE-specific JavaScript functions that
   wrap those two atoms, and take simple strings as arguments, which lets the
   IE driver call the atom directly without having to call a separate script
   that simply creates the JavaScript criteria object.
 * Removed extra round-trips through JavaScript engine when executing
   JavaScript. This should provide a slight performance boost when executing
   JavaScript that returns arrays or JavaScript objects.

v2.33.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Corrected logic in getting location of element after scrolling into view.
   For IE 6 and 7, an additional 2-pixel offset must be added for every frame
   on the page when calculating element location.

v2.33.0.1
=========
 * Refactored session shutdown code to properly wait for thread termination.
   Fixes issue #5543.

v2.33.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.32.3.13
==========
 * Modified to better detect focus on incorrect UI elements when
   requireWindowFocus is specified.

v2.32.3.12
==========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Prevent double-clicks when using WebElement.click(). When using the 
   requireWindowFocus capability, it's possible that multiple calls to 
   WebElement.click() might happen too quickly, and they might be interpreted
   as a double-click. This change inspects the last time an element was clicked
   on, and if it is within the system double-click time, it waits until that
   time passes before performing the second click.
 * Made InputManager more robust in the requireWindowFocus case. Previously, 
   using the Windows SendInput API could cause keystrokes and mouse events to
   be added to the system message queue, but would return back to the caller
   before those events were processed by Internet Explorer's message loop.
   This change adds a Windows mouse hook and keyboard hook to monitor when
   the messages are processed by an applications message loop. There is still a
   potential race condition, and users may still need to execute some local
   synchronization code.

v2.32.3.11
==========
 * Refactored IE driver element click code to all use InputManager class. 
   Previously, WebElement.click() used a different code path than the Advanced
   User Interactions API. These code paths are now unified for the native
   events case.

v2.32.3.10
==========
 * Reinstated separate-thread execution of JavaScript on Windows 8. This
   functionality had been disabled in 2.26.1.2, because of crashes in the IE
   driver on Windows 8. It seems likely that the COM object lifetime cleanup
   that happened in 2.31.0.2 corrected these problems. There is a possibililty,
   however, that the root cause of the Windows 8 crashes is still in place. If
   that is the case, this change should be rolled back.

v2.32.3.9
=========
 * Modified to check the editable state of an element before clearing.
   The clear Automation Atom normally checks that an element is interactable
   and editable before attempting to clear it. A previous change fixed the case
   for checking the interactable state, but not the editable state. The driver
   will now check the editable state as well. To facilitate this, a new atom
   has been exposed for checking the editable state.

v2.32.3.8
=========
 * Modified to check the interactable state of an element before clearing.
   The clear Automation Atom normally checks that an element is interactable
   before attempting to clear it. Unfortunately, when the atom is run on a
   separate thread in legacy IE, the error states do not get propagated back to
   the calling thread properly. To avoid this problem, the driver will check
   the interactable state before calling the clear atom. To facilitate this, a
   new atom has been exposed for checking the interactable state.

v2.32.3.7
=========
 * Increased timeout for asynchronous JavaScript execution. This allows more
   time for automation atoms to complete their operations before timing out.
 * Modified to throw if an element is not enclosed within a form in IE.

v2.32.3.6
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Refactoring asynchronous execution of JavaScript in IE driver. This
   introduces a new method for executing JavaScript functions asynchronously
   via a new thread. This centralizes the code used to execute automation atoms
   that may cause an alert to display (like click or submit or clear). Fixes
   issue #5556.

v2.32.3.5
=========
 * Corrected logic error in implementing loop. The code was intended to use a
   loop, but instead used a simple if statement.

v2.32.3.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added retry loop for handling alerts on shutdown. Previously the IE session
   would only check twice for alerts on shutdown. This handles the case of
   repeated alerts, and will check up to six times, for a total of 30 seconds.

v2.32.3.3
=========
 * Corrected dismissal of dialogs on browser quit. The IESession object already
   had code to check that the IECommandExecutor had fully quit before shutting
   down the thread on which the executor was running. However, it had no code
   to handle the case where all browser instances for that session were not
   properly shut down. Now the session will ask the executor to check one final
   time and make one last-ditch effort to dismiss any dialogs and shut down
   the browser instances. Please note that the best practice is to handle any
   alerts that may appear in web pages being automated before executing
   driver.quit(); this should only be used as a last resort.

v2.32.3.2
=========
 * Corrected dismissal of onBeforeUnload dialogs. We now notify the button's
   immediate parent, instead of sending a message to the button. Sending the
   BM_CLICK message to the button can fail if the dialog doesn't have the 
   system focus.

v2.32.3.1
=========
 * Corrected logic error in alert handling. A slight logic error in the alert
   handling code was causing the alert handling to not wait for the alert to be
   completely dismissed before continuing. This was causing a race condition
   that could lead to crashes when quitting the browser if certain types of
   alerts were active. Fixes issue #5489.

v2.32.3.0
=========
 * Corrected number of script arguments in InputManager::SendKeystrokes. In a
   recent refactor, this code was slightly changed, and the declaration of a
   Script object was expecting three arguments instead of the required four.
   Fixes issue #5502.

v2.32.2.0
=========
 * Corrected logic error in reading TabProcGrowth registry value. The
   TabProcGrowth registry value can be a DWORD or a string. If it is a string,
   it can be a numeric string (e.g., "0"), and still be treated by Internet
   Explorer as if it were an actual numeric value. This change to
   BrowserFactory::GetRegistryValue() correctly handles both cases, coercing
   the value to a string type for comparison.

v2.32.1.0
=========
 * Modified IEDriverServer to take new command-line switches to allow click on
   users to force the use of the Windows CreateProcess API for launching IE.
   For some cases, it may be necessary to launch IE in Private mode for
   testing in parallel on a single node. To support this, there must be a way
   to force the IE driver to use the Windows CreateProcess() API to launch IE
   so that the user can specify command-line switches. To preserve the
   ability to locate the correct process for IE versions 8 and higher, a
   registry value must be set to a specific value, and the IE driver checks for
   the registry value before launching IE. Patch for this fix provided by Alex
   Savchuk.The registry settings are:

    Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\Main
    Value Name: TabProcGrowth
    Value: "0"

 * Fixed Element::IsAttachedToDom() when used with SVG for IEDriver.
   Patch for this fix provided by Patrick Gansterer.

v2.32.0.1
=========
 * Fixed to allow click on visible portion of element if center point cannot be
   scrolled into view. This fixes issue #4390 for IE. There is still a fix that
   needs to be made for Firefox for the issue to be closed. Patch provided by
   Alex Savchuk.

v2.32.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.31.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixing to no longer allow stale element references to be used in JavaScript
   execution. The driver now checks the return value when recursively walking
   JavaScript arrays and objects. Fixes issue #4769. Patch provided by Alex
   Savchuk.

v2.31.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Refactored IE element finder to make clearer when Sizzle is used.
   Previously, it was not as easy to determine from IEDriverServer.exe logs
   when Sizzle was being used for finding elements by CSS selector. It is now
   explicitly called out and logged. Also, automation atoms are being used when
   Sizzle is not necessary.
 * Simplified COM object handling code in IE driver. COM objects are now
   correctly referenced everywhere via smart pointers, and use of some aliased
   types is now replaced by the C++ primitives.

v2.31.0.1
=========
 * Added ability to get current URL from IWebBrowser2 if IHTMLDocument2 fails.
   Under normal circumstances, the IE driver gets the current URL from the
   document loaded in the browser. When IE browses to a non-HTML page, such as
   a PDF file with the Adobe Reader plugin installed, getting the document
   fails, since there is no "document" in the browser. In that case, fall back
   to getting the LocationURL property of the IWebBrowser2 interface. It's
   arguable that this is the wrong thing to do, since the driver is useless
   without an actual document, but we'll let this work anyway. Fixes issue
   #5361.
 * Updated logic in IE driver to correctly wait for the document. Fixes issue
   #5326.
 * Submit should throw NoSuchElementException if the target element is not
   within a form. Implemented in atoms, Firefox and HtmlUnit.
 * Reinstated execution of JavaScript on separate thread for IE10 on Windows 7.
 * Removed use of CComQIPtr from IE driver native code. The use of CComQIPtr is
   not needed, as we are substituting a call to the QueryInterface method
   instead. This is what CComQIPtr does under the covers anyway.

v2.31.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.30.2.3
=========
 * Introduced "browserAttachTimeout" capability. This allows the user to set a
   capability to control how long the IE driver will attempt to locate an IE
   browser window belonging to the iexplore.exe process launched by the driver.
   This is to overcome the bug reported by some users that the IELaunchURL
   Windows API reports the incorrect process ID for the launched iexplore.exe
   process. In this case, there is nothing the IE driver can do about the
   problem as the bug is inside IE itself. However, this will allow a user
   to exit the offending situation early, and attempt to recover. The 
   capability expects an integer value, representing the number of milliseconds
   the driver will contininue to look for the newly-launched IE window. Setting
   the capability to 0 (which is its default value) will cause the IE driver to
   wait indefinitely. Fixes issue #4541.

v2.30.2.2
=========
 * Fixed issues found via static code analysis.

v2.30.2.1
=========
 * Simplified element scroll calculation code by using the new
   isInParentOverflow atom.

v2.30.2.0
=========
 * Hacked around the case where McAfee SiteAdvisor is installed as a plugin for
   IE. Modal dialogs are now checked for existence of the WS_CAPTION style.
   Note that if IE ever decides to change how it displays alerts, this may
   begin to cause failures in alert detection. Fixes issue #4839.

v2.30.1.0
=========
 * Updates to version resources. No functional changes.

v2.30.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixed incorrect JSON return values for findElements when an error occurs.
   This is a "best-faith" effort at resolving reports of NullPointerExceptions
   in Java. If future occurrances of the symptoms are found, please open a new
   issue. Fixes issue #3800.

v2.29.1.2
=========
 * Fixed auto-release of modifier keys when using element.SendKeys with 
   requireWindowFocus capability. 

v2.29.1.1
=========
 * Enabled synthetic events mouse clicks to work even when the click triggers
   a JavaScript alert. 

v2.29.1.0
=========
 * Updated to use correct parameter in message loop for executing asynchronous
   JavaScript. Fixes issue #5137.

v2.29.0.4
=========
 * Allowed the IE driver to get the text of a prompt() dialog window. Fixes
   issue #4594.

v2.29.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Removed checking for element visibility and non-zero size from method used
   for scrolling elements into view and getting their location.
 * Fixed unexpected occurrences of UnhandledAlertException after closing modal
   dialogs created using showModalDialog().

v2.29.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified method for checking whether modifier keys should be automatically
   released when calling sendKeys, either from an element or from the actions
   class.

v2.29.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified findElement implementations to fail without waiting for the
   implicit wait timeout to expire if finding on a closed window. Fixes issue
   #5057.

v2.29.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Dampened excessive noise in IE driver logging.
 * Modified to initialize value_ member of Response to Json::Value::null upon
   creation.
 * Updated IEDriverServer.exe to correctly return the current version in the 
   JSON response for the /status end point of the JSON wire protocol.
 * Added usage info to IEDriverServer.exe when using /? /h or /help.
 * Removed dead code from ScreenshotCommandHandler.

v2.28.0.4
=========
 * Initialized value_ member of Response to Json::Value::null upon creation.
 * Suppressed warnings written to console during browser startup and shutdown.
 * Updated to correctly return the current version in the JSON response for the
   /status end point of the JSON wire protocol.
 * Added usage info to IEDriverServer.exe when using /? /h or /help. Also
   removed dead code from ScreenshotCommandHandler.

v2.28.0.3
=========
 * Introduced the "requireWindowFocus" capability into the IE driver. When used
   in conjunction with the "nativeEvents" capability, the driver will attempt 
   to bring the current IE window to the foreground before executing a mouse
   or keyboard event. Also, when the requireWindowFocus capability is set to
   true, advanced user interactions will now use the Windows SendInput() API to
   execute the interactions. To enable this behavior, set the value of the
   requiresWindowFocus capability to "true" when creating an instance of the IE
   driver. The default for this new capability is "false". This functionality
   is currently considered extremely experimental; use at your own risk.

v2.28.0.2
=========
 * Changed view port calculations to allow for always-present vertical scroll
   bar, and to test for horizontal scroll bar and adjust as required by page
   content. Fixes issue #3602.
 * Changed IE GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView behavior to take the 2-pixel
   border of the <html> element used by IE7 and below (and document modes that
   emulate that).
 * Extracted map of managed elements in IE driver to ElementRepository class.
   First step in a potentially larger refactor.

v2.28.0.1
=========
 * Attempted to change coordinate calculations due to frame offsets to handle
   the cross-domain frame case. This change rests on the assumption that the
   order of frames returned by the JavaScript document.frames collection is
   the same as that returned by document.getElementByTagName("frame") or
   document.getElementByTagName("iframe"). Fixes issue #4948.

v2.28.0.0
=========
 * Changed the shared WebDriver C++ server component to use strings in
   serialized commands instead of integers. Testing does not seem to indicate
   this will introduce a performance issue, and it makes logs more intelligible
   when logging the raw JSON of a received command. As far as anyone can
   determine, the only consumer of this component is the IEDriverServer.exe, so
   this should be a completely internal change.

v2.27.0.0
=========
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.26.3.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Define document on goog.global for fragments, as the closure library now
   depends on it. Fixes issue #4802.

v2.26.2.6
=========
 * Fixed SendKeysCommandHandler to check that the focus is in the HTML display
   pane, and not some other UI element (like the address bar) before sending
   the keystrokes.

v2.26.2.5
=========
 * Added new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup". When set to true, the
   IE driver will clean the known-element cache of invalid elements after
   every page load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve
   performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this capability is
   provided temporarily to allow disabling this behavior if problems arise.
   The default of this new capability is "true", meaning this behavior is
   turned on by default.
 * Refactored IE driver Element class to contain IsAttachedToDom() method,
   and IECommandHandler::GetElement() to use it.
 * Modified to avoid logging the tag name of the element if getting the tag
   name fails in the IE driver. Fixes issue #4811.

v2.26.2.4
=========
 * Corrected fix to issue #4800 to better handle nested frames.
 * Refactored native code to return the location of each frame containing an
   element.
 * Refactored location methods of native IE driver code to take a LocationInfo
   struct instead of separate args for x, y, width and height.

v2.26.2.3
=========
 * On behalf of AdamWu: Fixed calculation of coordinates for elements in 
   frames/iframes where the element is scrolled out of view within the frame.
   Fixes issue #4800.

v2.26.2.2
=========
 * Disabled execution of JavaScript code on a separate thread for IE10. This
   reverts the behavior of the driver to that before 2.26.1.0 for IE10 *only*.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.26.2.1
=========
 * Modified to return ENOSUCHDRIVER if a session is not available.

v2.26.2.0
=========
 * Fixed synchronization issues. These issues were always present, but never
   manifested until the IE driver was used with IE 10.
 * Reinstating functionality to run JavaScript on a separate thread on Windows
   8.

v2.26.1.2
=========
 * Removed functionality to run JavaScript on a separate thread on Windows 8.

v2.26.1.1
=========
 * Attempted to resolve crash on Windows 8 introduced by JavaScript execution
   on a separate thread. Added checks for proper interface marshaling on the
   worker thread.

v2.26.1.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered by onchange of <select>
   elements or by onsubmit of <form> elements. Fixes issue #3508. Fixes 
   issue #2103.

v2.26.0.9
=========
 * Modified scroll behavior in IE driver SendKeysCommandHandler to call 
   Element::GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView() instead of calling the DOM 
   scrollIntoView() function. Fixes issue #4393.
 * Modified to not call blur() on focusing element if the active element is
   the <body> element. This should no longer cause the IE window to drop to
   the bottom of the Z-order. Fixes issue #2353 and related.

v2.26.0.8
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.26.0.7
=========
 * Modified so that closing a window (or quitting a browser) now sets the 
   focused frame to NULL, as if switchTo().defaultContent() had been called.
   This is to prevent crashes of the executable when quitting the driver. Fixes
   issue #4178.

v2.26.0.6
=========
 * Added use of a mutex when creating a session. This should allow multiple
   threads to create and use different instances of IEDriverServer.exe,
   enabling multiple instances under most language bindings.
 * Added enablePersistentHover capability to allow users to turn off persistent
   mouse hover within the IE driver.

v2.26.0.5
=========
 * Refactored alert handling to allow handling of OnBeforeUnload dialogs. This
   is a slightly incomplete solution, as the dialog is not automatically
   handled on window close/browser exit. To work around this limitation,
   navigate to a different page (handling the OnBeforeUnload dialog), then
   call the quit() method.

v2.26.0.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.26.0.3
=========
 * Allowed buttons on alerts with control IDs of IDRETRY to be handled as 
   "OK" buttons, which should allow them to be handled by Alert.accept().

v2.26.0.2
=========
 * Modified find-by-XPath code to correctly escape embedded quotes before
   invoking the findElement atom.

v2.26.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updated to use Wicked Good XPath (http://code.google.com/p/wicked-good-xpath)
   as the XPath engine for the IE driver.

v2.26.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.25.3.6
=========
 * Modified behavior such that sending a Quit command on a non-existent
   session is now a no-op, and does not return an error code.

v2.25.3.5
=========
 * Added command-line switch to control to where the IEDriver.dll is extracted.
   Not specifying the switch causes the file to be extracted to the temp 
   directory.

v2.25.3.4
=========
 * Corrected searching for alert windows from windows opened by 
   showModalDialog().

v2.25.3.3
=========
 * Implemented "silent" command-line switch on IEDriverServer.exe to suppress
   printing to console of initial diagnostic information.

v2.25.3.2
=========
 * Implemented check in GetCurrentWindowHandleCommandHandler to verify that
   window handle is a valid window, returning a NoSuchWindowException if it
   is not. This was originally broken in r17651.

v2.25.3.1
=========
 * Implemented checks to ensure alerts are completely dismissed by IE before
   continuing to the next command.

v2.25.3.0
=========
 * Implemented automatic dismissal of alerts, settable by capability.
 * Implemented navigation back and forward through browser history on a
   separate thread, so as to no longer hang on alerts.

v2.25.2.3
=========
 * Fixed the case verifying whether a page in the browser is an HTML page, and
   the default browser does not register its MIME type in the (default) value
   at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<browser HTML page class name>. Fixes issue #4307.

v2.25.2.2
=========
 * Increased logging when getting registry values.
 * Fixed spacing in log messages 

v2.25.2.1
=========
 * Updated to return ENOSUCHWINDOW if trying to switch to a window ID that does
   not exist.

v2.25.2.0
=========
 * Fixed IE6 case for checking browser zoom level.
 * Now repeatedly sending WM_MOUSEMOVE messages on a separate thread to try to
   quell mouse hover issues.

v2.25.1.0
=========
 * Added error checking for zoom level for IE. The IE driver will now throw an
   exception if the zoom level isn't 100%. This behavior can be disabled in the
   IE driver by setting the "ignoreZoomLevel" capability. Fixes Issue #4272.
 * Stop execution when a call to IWebBrowser2::Navigate2() fails in the IE
   driver. This prevents a hang when we weren't checking for an error
   condition. Fixes issue #4279.

v2.25.0.0
=========
 * Handle quirky handling of mime types if Firefox was ever the default browser
   on a Windows installation, but now a different (non-IE) browser has stepped
   into that role.
 * Increased timeout for finding file upload dialog in uploading file. Fixes
   issue #3858.
 * Updated initialization of variables in MouseMoveToCommandHandler.h and in
   GetElementLocationOnceScrolledIntoViewCommandHandler.h. Fixes issue #4205.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.24.2.0
=========
 * Refactoring command line argument handling in IEDriverServer.exe, now that
   the number of valid arguments is growing.
 * Added ability to control log level and log file via command line switches to
   IEDriverServer.exe (on behalf of AlexandrSavchuk).
 * Re-added else-if for GetSessionList command inadvertently removed in r15345.
   Fixes issue #4160.
 * Added logging message to a large portion of the IE driver (on behalf of 
   AlexandrSavchuk). Set the log file with

      --log-file="C:\full\path\to\filename.log"

   (default is to log to the console). Set the logging level with

      --log-level=LOGLEVEL

   where LOGLEVEL is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL (default
   is FATAL). Fixes issue #4159

v2.24.1.0
=========
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.24.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.23.2.0
=========
 * Crash prevention for when there is no "current" browser window, like when
   the current window is closed without the user switching to another window.
   Fixes issue #4071.

v2.23.1.1
=========
 * Crash prevention for when IWebBrowser2::get_Document() returns S_FALSE.
   Fixes issue #4064.

v2.23.1.0

 * Updated error messaging for certain conditions of Element.Click()

v2.23.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.22.1.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.22.1.0
=========
 * Re-enabling native code driver to understand "nativeEvents" capability.
   This was disabled due to CI-build restrictions which have now been resolved.

v2.22.0.0
=========
 * Initial release required by client language bindings.
