- Ant script does everything now - compile, create jar, run self-tests, start/stop server, standalone test, distributed test
- Removed all shell scripts
- Upgraded Jetty
- Distributed test run is no longer part of the JsUnitServer - it's just a test to which you pass the remoteURLs
- Preferred way to specify properties is no longer using jsunit.properties
