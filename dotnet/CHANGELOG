v2.26.0
=======
 * Prevent firefox from updating, checking and warning for extension and plugin
   updates
 * Bumping .NET HttpWebRequest service point connection limit to 2000. Fixes 
   issue #4526.
 * Handled the case where a JSON Wire Protocol error response contains a null
   value for the message property. Also guarded against null values in other 
   members of the error response.
 * Added .NET implementation of PhantomJSDriver, as a headless option for .NET
   users. This driver requires PhantomJS and GhostDriver. Since the GhostDriver
   project isn't ready to be used just yet, these classes are marked with 
   "internal" visibility. When the GhostDriver project is ready, these classes
   will be made public. Also including test enhancements for use with 
   PhantomJS.
 * Made keep-alive configurable on .NET HttpCommandExecutor and
   DriverServiceCommandExecutor.
 * Shortcut trying to convert element to ILocatable if an Action in the .NET
   bindings is called specifically with a null value for element.
 * Added the LibraryExtractionPath propery to InternetExplorerDriverService to
   be able to set the location to which the support library of the
   IEDriverServer.exe is extracted. 
 * Implementing SuppressInitialDiagnosticInformation property on DriverService
   to allow users of standalone driver servers to suppress the display of the
   initial information from the console via the -silent switch.
 * Updated .NET Actions class to accept IWebDriver objects that implement
   IWrapsDriver as well as IHasInputDevices. Similarly, actions now can take
   IWebElement objects that implement IWrapsElement as well as ILocatable. This
   allows the use of EventFiringWebDriver objects directly without casting in
   end-user code.
 * Changing the disposal semantics of the .NET bindings to more closely match
   the .NET Framework disposal semantics. This means that calling Dispose() on
   a driver is equivalent to calling Quit(), which enables usage of the using()
   construct.
 * Replaced throwing of System.TimeoutException with throwing
   WebDriverTimeoutException, which now descends from WebDriverException.
 * Added .NET InternetExplorerOptions.UnexpectedAlertBehavior property to
   specify how unexpected alerts are handled by the IE driver.
 * Updated the .NET deployment build to use ILMerge, which merges the dependent
   assemblies into the main WebDriver.dll assembly. This also removes
   dependencies on NuGet packages for the core WebDriver.dll assembly.
 * Updated .NET UnhandledAlertException to include a reference to the Alert not
   handled.
 * Expose setting the port for DriverService-based drivers.
 * Removed visibility of Finder property for FindsByAttribute. This will never
   work because of .NET's rules around attribute parameter types.
 * Made .NET 4.0 the default of the .NET bindings for development and
   debugging.
 * Updated constructor to .NET Actions class to check that driver parameter
   implements IHasInputDevices.

v2.25.1
=======
 * Updated InternetExplorerOptions to allow users to set the IgnoreZoomLevel
   setting.
 * Exposed constructors in ChromeDriver and InternetExplorerDriver that allow
   passing a DriverService object. This gives the user more control over the
   properties of the DriverService.
 * Updated exception thrown by .NET SafariDriver when a connection to the 
   driver is not created within 45 seconds.
 * Cleaned up documentation comment warning on build of the .NET implementation
   of WebDriverBackedSelenium.

v2.25.0
=======
 * Updated Json.NET version to 4.5r7. Also changing NuGet packaging to no
   longer rely on specific package version of dependencies.
 * Updated FxCop/StyleCop global warning suppressions file.
 * Updated InternetExplorerDriverService to be able to manipulate the command
   line switches using strongly-typed properties of the object.
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align 
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1. This commit
   includes an addition to the InternetExplorerOptions of the .NET bindings.
 * Fixed element finding and table handling in .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium.

v2.24.0
=======
 * Updated OpenQA.Selenium.Support.PageObjects.FindsByAttribute so that overridden
   operators correctly handle the null case. Fixes issue #4070.

v2.23.0
=======
 * Removed the embedded IE server from the .NET bindings. From now on, you 
   *must* use the IE standalone server with .NET.
 * Removed unneeded polling for parent.lock file on anonymous Firefox profile
   in temp directory.

v2.22.1
=======
 * Not all browser driver implementations understand the generic set timeouts
   HTTP endpoint of the JSON wire protocol, instead responding to the
   deprecated specific endpoints for each timeout. Fixes issue #4015. 

v2.22.0
=======
 * The .NET IE driver implementation now looks for the IE standalone server. 
   Please note that if you do not set the option in InternetExplorerOptions
   to use the legacy server, the constructor *will* throw an exception. There 
   is no automatic fallback to using the embedded .dll, because there's no 
   standard way in the .NET framework to alert the user to a condition that 
   needs attention at runtime, and guarantee it will be seen.
 * Implemented ability to set page load timeout in the .NET bindings.
 * Added tests to .NET bindings to align more closely with Java.
 * Added ByChained support to the WebDriver.Support assembly. Also created 
   additions to the .NET PageFactory to allow decorating members with multiple
   instances of FindsByAttribute, including ordering of the attributes (issue
   #3870, code supplied by KellySummerlin).
 * Updated .NET bindings InternetExplorerOptions to allow the user to disable
   native events for IE. Note that actually doing this is not recommended as of
   this release.
 * Added .NET version of LoadableComponent and SlowLoadableComponent to the
   WebDriver.Support assembly (code supplied by KellySummerlin).
 * Trivially refactored the constructors of "service-based" drivers for .NET
   bindings.
 * Made .NET unit tests more friendly to non-Windows operating systems (using
   Mono).
 * Updated .NET Safari driver to conform to the new message format in r16716.
 * Implemented an InitialBrowserUrl property in InternetExplorerOptions to
   allow the user to customize the page loaded when IE launches. This can be 
   used in conjunction with IntroduceInstabilityByIgnoringProtectedModeSettings
   property to set the initial Protected Mode zone of the browser. However,
   this is still by far a second-best choice, and the first choice should 
   *always* be to actually set the Protected Mode settings of each zone. If a 
   user is using this property, only a "best effort" at support will be given.
 * Added Android to Platform enumeration (issue #3242).
 * Allow user-defined installation path for Safari in the SafariDriver.
 * Changed .NET DesiredCapabilities.Android() to correctly assign a platform 
   value of Android.

v2.21.0
=======
 * Updated NoSuchFrameException, NoSuchWindowException, and
   NoAlertPresentException to properly descend from NotFoundException
   in the .NET bindings.
 * Modifying .NET PageFactory so that elements marked with the FindBy 
   attribute can be used with the interactions API.
 * Updated Json.NET dependency to 4.5r1 and NuGet.exe to 1.7.
 * Changed the name of the standalone IE driver server from 
   InternetExplorerDriver.exe to IEDriverServer.exe
 * Removed recently added restore window command from .NET bindings.
 * Extracted FindFreePort method in .NET to a common utility class.
 * Landed the .NET SafariDriver. Woot!
 * Added a WebSocket server implementation.
 * Implemented window maximize and restore WebDriver commands for the .NET
   bindings.
 * Fixed .NET FirefoxExtension to allow for parallel installation of extensions
   into profiles being run by parallel tests.
 * Fixed .NET RemoteWebDriver to translate a single null deliberately passed in
   as a script arg into an arg array containing the null.
 * Upped service point connection limit for Selenium RC command processor
 * Fixed .NET EventFiring WebDriver to switch to a frame using the wrapped
   element. Fixes issue #3329.
 * Removed deprecated constructors on .NET bindings InternetExplorerDriver

 * Updated to JSON.NET to 4.0r6
 * Refactored ChromeDriverService to be a subclass of a base DriverService 
   class, designed to allow any JSON Wire Protocol-compliant standalone server
   executable to be used as a service. This adds all required work for the 
   .NET bindings to begin using the standalone IE remote server.
 * Enable CODE_ANALYSIS flag for Debug builds so that standalone FxCop can
   take advantage of GlobalSuppressions.cs.
 * Added help text to the exception message for WebDriverBackedSelenium, in
   the case that the Start() method has not been called on the instance.

v2.17.0
=======
 * Reverted the .NET remote Command object to return an empty string
   instead of an empty JSON object ("{}") when the command has no parameters.
 * Introduced ChromeOptions class for use with the ChromeDriver. This makes
   obsolete calling constructors on ChromeDriver that take an ICapabilities
   object.
 * Updated the .NET PageFactory to traverse the inheritance tree to find
   custom attributes (Issue #3172)
 * Added toolkit.telemetry.enabled and toolkit.telemetry.rejected to the
   default profile used by the FirefoxDriver.

v2.16.0
=======
 * Made By, Cookie and Screenshot .NET classes serializable.
 * Slightly modifying build output to be more informative when building
   .NET bindings from within the Visual Studio IDE.
 * Explicitly setting socket.ExclusiveAddressUse = true when attempting to 
   find a free port for the .NET bindings' FirefoxDriver.
 * Updating the .NET remote Command object to return an empty JSON object 
   ("{}") instead of an empty string when the command has no parameters.
 * Implementing the /sessions and /status commands for the IE driver and the
   .NET bindings.
 * Check elements' internal IDs for equality before making RPC call to 
   determine IWebElement equality in .NET.
 * Removed unused JSON wire protocol command values from the .NET bindings.

 * Added "extensions.autoDisableScopes" to default Firefox profile
 * Removes the deprecated SendModifierKey command, replacing it with
   SendKeysToActiveElement
 * Added IntroduceInstabilityByIgnoringProtectedModeSettings to
   InternetExplorerDriver to make setting capabilities easier when
   bypassing the Protected Mode settings check of the IE driver

======
  * Look up private parent fields when using the support classes PageFactory.
  * Preparing RemoteWebDriver to understand upcoming URI changes to JSON wire
  * protocol.
