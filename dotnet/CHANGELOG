V3.0.0-beta2
============
 * Updated GetAttribute shim for GetAttribute method for W3C protocol remote
   ends.
 * Modified parameter name in SendKeys to alert for W3C protocol remote
   ends.

V3.0.0-beta1
============
 * The Mozilla-provided Marionette-based FirefoxDriver is now the default
   implementation for automating Firefox. Additionally, this aligns the
   FirefoxDriver class with other browser-specific implementations, using
   a FirefoxOptions class for setting options for the browser session. 
   Constructors of FirefoxDriver directly referencing FirefoxProfile or
   FirefoxBinary have been marked as deprecated, and will be removed in a 
   future release.

v2.53.0
=======
 * This will be the final full release in the 2.x series. There may be
   small point releases going forward, but future development will 
   concentrate on 3.0.
 * (on behalf of arnonaxelrod) Added an overload of ExecuteJavaScript
   extension method that doesn't accept a generic argument and doesn't
   return a value.
 * (on behalf of mohammadsavadkuhi) Corrected argument name in
   exceptions thrown by DefaultWait<T>.
 * Corrected trace categories for Chrome perf logging prefs in .NET.
 * Added device metrics to Chrome options for mobile emulation.
 * Removed .NET type-safe option for setting IE cookie capability. The
   'ie.validateCookieDocumentType' has been obsolete since 2.47 of WebDriver.
   This commit marks the 'ValidateCookieDocumentType' property of the
   'InternetExplorerOptions' object as obsolete, and no longer sends that
   capability to the driver. This property will be removed in a future
   version of the .NET bindings.

v2.52.0
=======
 * Updated Firefox driver to include ability to disable overlapping element
   check. This includes a new constant for the name of the capability.
 * Provided an implementation of the local-end logging API.
 * Provided type-safe option to allow disabling of full-page screenshots when
   using the IE driver.
 * (on behalf of Glib Briia) Updated support library's SelectElement class to
   better handle <select multiple='multiple'> elements.

v2.51.0
=======
 * Updated Firefox driver which includes fixes for the clicking in overlapped
   elements. In keeping with project support policy for Firefox, This driver
   has been tested with Firefox 44 (current release), 43 (immediately prior
   release), 38 (current ESR release), and 31 (immediately prior ESR release).
 * Refactoring .NET driver Options classes to descend from common class. This
   commit introduces a common base class for driver-specific type-safe Options
   classes (e.g., ChromeOptions, InternetExplorerOptions, etc.). This will
   help pave the way to eliminate needing to know the name or expected type
   of arbitrary capabilities in a future release.
 * Removed the incorrect ChromeOptions method introduced in 2.50.0.
 * Added ability to add traceCategories to performance logging preferences in
   ChromeOptions. Fixes issue #1591.

v2.50.1
=======
 * Changed ChromeOptions to have correct EnableMobileEmulation API.

v2.50.0
=======
 * Updated embedded Firefox driver with new click algorithm
 * Added type-safe options .NET for recently added Chrome capabilities. 
   This includes adding type-safe capabilities for 'mobileEmulation',
   'perfLoggingPrefs', and 'windowTypes' to ChromeOptions class.
 * (on behalf Edward Ned Harvey) Updated ChromeDriverService to locate
   Chrome driver executable in a cross-platform way.
 * Removed deprecated PageFactory code.
 * Updated implementations of EWebDriver.PageSource property and
   IAlert.SendKeys method for spec-compliant browsers.
 * Updated implementations for finding by ID, class name, and tag name
   for consistency between languages and for compatibility with spec-
   compliant drivers.
 * Removed the redundant IllegalLocatorException.

v2.49.0
=======
 * Updated .NET PageFactory to allow frame switching with located elements.
   Previously, if you located a `<frame>` or `<iframe>` element using the
   PageFactory attributes, you could not switch to it. This change allows one
   to use `driver.SwitchTo().Frame(element)` with the element found via the
   PageFactory.
 * Added workaround for Windows 10 major version number encountered when
   executing via NUnit 3.
 * Issue #1316: (on behalf of Chris Block) Enhance check for value types to
   exclude Nullable in extension methods. The System.Nullable type is a value
   type that can be assigned the null value. This change checks for types
   wrapped with Nullable and does not throw when they are encountered.
 * Exposed session ID property on RemoteWebDriver. Users can now cast their
   driver instance to IHasSessionId to access the SessionId property, which
   returns a SessionId object. To use the SessionId object with external
   tools, simply call the ToString() method on the instance. Note that
   relying on the SessionId for anything is probably a Bad Thing, because it
   introduces a leak in the abstraction of a driver. Please do not use this
   property; its introduction is the Wrong Approach, but it's being exposed
   at the insistence of a selection of users.
 * Adding support for whitelisted-ips argument for Chrome and IE driver
   executables.

v2.48.2
=======
 * Release containing fix to Firefox driver bug when clearing input fields of
   type number.

v2.48.1
=======
 * Various updates in communicating with remote ends using the W3C dialect of
   the JSON wire protocol.
 * (on behalf of petruc) Added HTML5 functionality to .NET bindings. The .NET
   bindings now include the ability to access appCache status, local and
   session storage, and geolocation. Each feature has a role-based marker
   interface (IHasApplicationCache, IHasWebStorage, or IHasLocationContext),
   and the implementation has a boolean property to query if the driver
   supports that feature. Attempting to use the feature for a driver which
   does not support it will throw an exception.
 * Issue #1120: Fixed deserialization of date-time data from remote ends.
 * Issue #1186: Safari should only specify MAC as platform in default desired
   capabilities.

v2.48.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox version 31 (immediately previous ESR).
   Native event support has been discontinued for versions of Firefox later
   than 33. Synthetic events tested on Firefox versions 31 (immediately
   previous ESR), 38 (current ESR), and 40 (immediately previous release),
   and 41 (current release).
 * Refactored JSON deserialization for responses.
 * Modified SwitchTo().Frame(string) to use client-side code instead of a
   direct wire protocol call.
 * Added support for the W3C Specification dialect of the JSON wire protocol
 * Added initial support for Mozilla's Marionette implementation of the
   Firefox driver.

v2.47.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox version 31 (immediately previous ESR).
   Native event support has been discontinued for versions of Firefox later
   than 33. Synthetic events tested on Firefox versions 31 (immediately
   previous ESR), 38 (immediately previous release and current ESR), and 39
   (current release).
 * (provided by Microsoft) Added language bindings for Microsoft Edge browser.
 * Added support for authentication dialogs in the .NET bindings.
 * Replaced DotNetZip with ZipStorer library. Adds the ability to use the .NET
   bindings with Firefox on Linux and OS X via Mono. The replacement library
   uses the internal System.IO.Compression classes along with custom code for
   reading and writing the central director structure of .zip files. The
   resulting .zip files created may be slightly larger than those produced via
   DotNetZip, but we will sacrifice that small size difference in exchange for
   cross-platform usability.
 * Fixing cookie parsing error in .NET bindings. The JSON response for cookie
   expiration date is a number, not an integer. The .NET bindings were not
   handling the fact that a floating point number could be included in the JSON
   object as an expiration time.
 * Added support to .NET bindings for HTTP-only cookies.
 * Added ITakesScreenshot to .NET RemoteWebElement for spec compatibility Note
   that no driver implements this at present, so attempting to use this within
   any test will result in a NotImplementedException.
 * Fixed dynamic assembly generation for .NET PageFactory for .NET 3.5.

v2.46.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox version 31 (immediately previous ESR).
   Native event support has been discontinued for versions of Firefox later
   than 33. Synthetic events tested on Firefox versions 31 (immediately
   previous ESR), 37 (immediately previous release), and 38 (current release,
   and current ESR).
 * (on behalf of Darrin Cherry) Modified ExpectedConditions class to more
   closely mimic the one provided by Java.
 * Added ToString override to Platform class. Fixes issue #580.
 * Removed Firefox profile cleaning step when launching Firefox. Firefox used
   to require launching to clean up potential issues with the anonymous
   temporary profile that we use with the driver. This is no longer the case.
 * Added type safe support to InternetExplorerOptions for page load strategy.
 * Added ability to get wrapped IWebElement from SelectElement. When using a
   SelectElement wrapper class to manipulate <select> elements, the user
   previously had to keep a separate reference to the IWebElement representing
   the actual element. The SelectElement class now implements IWrapsElement,
   exposing the WrappedElement property, which gives the user the ability to
   access the underlying IWebElement. Fixes issue #350.
 * (on behalf of clz.livio) Added additional PhantomJS command-line options.
   Added the ProxyAuthorization property and SslCertificatesPath property to
   the PhantomJSDriverSerivce class. These translate to the --proxy-auth and
   --ssl-certificates-path command line options on PhantomJS respectively.
 * (on behalf of clz.livio) Improved DriverService to check response on
   startup. A driver using a driver service will now throw a WebDriverException
   if it cannot start the driver service, or if the service executable returns
   an invalid response. Note that the checks for the validation of the
   repsonses is minimal, checking for the Content-Type header and that the
   response code is a 200.
 * (on behalf of Sergey Tikhomirov) Refactored PageFactory implementation, 
   including a number of changes to make it more extensible and more robust.

   First, instead of the hand-rolled proxy classes that had been used
   previously, this refactor introduces proxy objects based on
   System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy, which allows for more
   flexibility in the types of objects proxied.
    
   Second, this refactor now allows users to provide their own implementation
   engines for examining attributes of Page Object classes and determining
   what course to take. To create a new implementation the user must provide
   an implementation of the IPageObjectMemberDecorator interface, which
   determines which attributes to examine fields and properties for, and how
   to create the proxy objects assigned to the members.
    
   Third, this refactor introduces a new IElementLocator interface to Page
   Object implementations, and deprecates the IElementLocatorFactory
   interface. The IElementLocator interface is substantially similar to the
   now-deprecated IElementLocatorFactory, but requires implementations to
   provide a property to retrieve the ISearchContext implementation used to
   actually find elements. The implications of this change are that
   IElementLocator implementations will need to keep a reference to the
   IWebDriver or IWebElement they are using. Recommended practice is for this
   context to be passed in via a the IElementLocator implementation's
   constructor, and this technique is demonstrated in the source code to the
   two implementations provided in the regular .NET language bindings
   releases.
    
   Finally, this commit also introduces a breaking change in
   IElementLocatorFactory. Developers of classes that implement this
   interface will now be required to implement the CreateLocator method,
   which will return a valid IElementLocator implmentation. This is to
   prepare for the removal of the IElementLocatorFactory interface and its
   implmentations in a future release.
 * Added FindsByAllAttribute to .NET PageFactory implementation. This allows
   the user to specify that an element must match the criteria of all of the
   FindsBy attributes a property or field is marked with in order to be found
   by the PageFactory. Previously, a class member marked with multiple FindsBy
   attributes would find an element matching any of the attributes' criteria.
   Because of the nature of this change, you cannot use FindsBySequence and
   FindsByAll on the same class member. Attempting to do so will result in an
   exception when InitElements is called.
 * (on behalf of Immanuel Hayden) Added support for ByAll, finding elements
   matching all locators.
 * (on behalf of Chris Block) Changed ExecuteJavaScript extension method for
   converting result, so that it now validates that the ExecuteJavaScript
   extension method will correctly detect if the script result is convertable
   to the generic type.
 * (on behalf of Yi Zeng) Added constructor overload which takes in single
   DriverService parameter. This pattern was already implemented in
   PhantomJSDriver, but not yet in ChromeDriver and InternetExplorerDriver.
 * Added ability to add custom wire protocol commands in .NET bindings. This
   allows projects that use a WebDriver-like JSON-over-HTTP wire protocol to
   add additional end points for their use. It does this by exposing (and
   renaming) a formerly internal method on the singleton CommandInfoRepository
   class. To add additonal commands, one would call the TryAddCommand method,
   which is now public. Fixes Google Code issue #8594.
 * Added ability to handle W3C spec compliant element serialization.
 * (on behalf of Eberhard Beilharz) Made PhantomJS driver more cross-platform
   aware. On Linux the filesystem is case-sensitive and executables don't end
   with ".exe". This change modifies the PhantomJSDriver to search for
   "phantomjs" on Unix systems while keeping the filename "PhantomJS.exe" on
   Windows. This allows to use the default constructor of the PhantomJSDriver
   class on Linux. Previously using the default c'tor resulted in an error that
   "PhantomJS.exe" can't be found.

v2.45.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 31 (current ESR), and
   24 (immediately previous ESR). Native event support has been discontinued
   for versions of Firefox later than 33.
 * Removed automatic installation of SafariDriver extention for .NET.
   From this point forward, users are expected to manually install the
   SafariDriver extension into their Safari installation in order to drive
   the browser. This is due to Apple's changes in architecture for Safari
   extensions.
 * Added initial implementation of .NET bindings OperaDriver. The .NET
   bindings will now support the Chromium-based Opera driver without
   requiring the use of the Java remote WebDriver server. This driver will
   work with Opera 26 and above, and requires the download of the Opera
   driver executable. Code cleanup and refactoring will take place under a
   separate commit. Note that there is still no support in the .NET bindings
   for the Presto-based Opera without using the remote server, nor is there
   likely to be.
 * Added option to not delete anonymous Firefox profile in .NET. This change
   adds an option to the .NET FirefoxProfile class so that the driver will
   not delete the anonymous profile created by the driver. Since the driver
   cannot and should not use an existing profile in situ because of the
   multiple instance automation case, this change means that modifications
   applied to the anonymous profile can be retained and used in future
   anonymous profiles. The implication is that the user can now make
   modifications to a profile, and retain those profile modifications (e.g.,
   cookies) into other future profiles, simulating persistent changes over
   multiple browser launches. Fixes issue #7374.
 * Introduced type safe option in InternetExplorerOptions to set the
   capability to disable check of mime type of the doucment when setting
   cookies. When setting cookies, there is a check in the IE driver to
   validate that the page in the browser is, in fact, an HTML page. Despite
   the fact that omitting this check can cause unrecoverable crashes in the
   driver, there is demand for a mechanism to disable this check for older,
   legacy versions of Internet Explorer. Fixes issue #1227.

v2.44.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 33 (current), 32 (immediately
   previous release), 31 (current ESR), and 24 (immediately previous ESR).
 * Rolled back improper spec compliance for finding elements.
 * Fixed WebDriverBackedSelenium compatibility with IE5. Fixes issue #7938.

v2.43.1
=======
 * Point-release to correct version resources in .NET bindings assemblies. No
   functional changes.

v2.43.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 32 (current), 31 (immediately
   previous release and current ESR), and 24 (immediately previous ESR).
 * Integrated the Microsoft Internet Explorer driver implementation into the
   .NET bindings. By setting the Implementation property of the .NET bindings'
   InternetExplorerDriverService class, the user can now force the driver to
   use the Microsoft implementation. Note that the default is to use the
   existing open-source implementation based on the Automation Atoms.
   Over time as the Microsoft implementation matures, this will be switched to
   use the Microsoft implementation, first by default, then exclusively.

   To use the Microsoft implementation, the user must have the August 2014
   updates to Internet Explorer installed through Windows Update, and must
   install the IE Web Driver Tool for Internet Explorer 11 download from
   Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44069).
 * Added safe check for window.localStorage in .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium
   implementation. Patch provided by Timofey Vasenin.
 * Implemented pluggable element locator factories for .NET PageFactory. This
   change allows the user to specify a custom IElementLocatorFactory for
   locating elements when used with the PageFactory. This gives much more
   control over the algorithm used to locate elements, and allows the
   incorporation of things like retries or handling of specific exceptions.
 * Issue #7367: Set Json.NET to ignore dates when parsing response values.
 * Issue #7419: Added support for SwitchTo().ParentFrame() in .NET bindings.
   This brings the .NET bindings into parity with other languages.
 * Belatedly removed long-obsolete .NET tests for AndroidDriver.

v2.42.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 29 (current), 28 (immediately
   previous), 24 (current ESR), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Updated Json.NET dependency to version 6.0.2.
 * Refactored JSON serialization of cookies.

v2.41.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 28 (current), 27 (immediately
   previous), 24 (current ESR), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Removed deprecated AndroidDriver
 * Added excludeSwitches to the list of known Chrome options
 * Implemented ITakesScreenshot in RemoteWebDriver base class instead of
   in browser-specific subclasses.
 * Refactored usage of command executors. We now use the same algorithm for
   creating and using a "command executor" for all current driver
   implementations. This removes some of the differences between Firefox and
   other implementations. It also prepares the way for unifying the
   construction of drivers using a common base Options class.

v2.40.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 27 (current), 26 (immediately
   previous), 24 (current ESR), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Issue #1175: Implemented ByIdOrName in .NET support package.
 * Issue #3283: Escaping backslashes when writing Firefox preferences to
   profile in .NET
 * Issue #3719: No longer redirecting console output for Firefox. This
   information was largely unused by anyone, and the implementation had a
   chance to produce deadlocks when reading from the console output stream for
   stdout and stderr.
 * Issue #4248: Added exception handling in .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium.
 * Issue #5692: Fixed when cookie expiration date received by .NET exceeds
   maximum DateTime value. When receiving a cookie via the JSON wire protocol,
   the expiration date is represented as the number of seconds after
   12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 GMT. When a number greater than or equal
   253402300800, this is larger than the maximum value of .NET's DateTime
   value. This change catches the ArgumentOutOfRangeException and forcibly sets
   the expiration to DateTime.MaxValue (12:59:59 PM December 31, 9999 GMT).
 * Issue #5755: Exposing property on .NET PhantomJSDriverService to specify IP
   address on which to listen for connections. When specifying a port on which
   PhantomJS should listen for WebDriver commands, the user has the option to
   also specify an IP address to which to bind to listen. This commit exposes
   that ability. It also exposes the ability to specify a Selenium Grid hub
   with which this instance of PhantomJS should register as a node.
 * Issue #6343: (on behalf of Ulrich Buchgraber) Make .NET DefaultWait stop
   swallowing original exception stack trace.
 * Issue #6699: Exposing process ID of service executable in .NET DriverService
   class. This allows the user to attempt to add the process to a Windows job
   object if they so desire, which will automatically kill child processes when
   the parent process is exited. Note that job objects are subject to security
   restrictions when used on Windows Vista or later.
 * Issue #6860: Updating .NET SafariDriver browser launch code. The initial
   start page from the temp directory that launches the WebSocket is loaded in
   Safari via a command line parameter. If the path contains a space, the load
   will fail. This is fixed by surrounding the temp file name with quotes.
 * Issue #6870: Updated FirefoxDriver constructor for ICapabilities. This
   allows the user to pass an ICapabilities object to the Firefox driver
   constructor and have specific capabilities used in driver instantiation.
 * Issue #6935: Changing .NET random temp file generation to be truly random. 
   The .NET bindings now use GUIDs as part of the file names for files and
   directories created in the temp directory. This is to work around potential
   collisions in random number generation encountered when using the .NET
   Random class, particularly in different processes. GUIDs are used as their
   generation in the .NET Framework is optimized for performance.
 * Issue #6966: Changed .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium OpenWindow to mimic Java.
   The JavaScript evaluated by the .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium OpenWindow
   command handler should return a null value from the eval() of the
   JavaScript to open the window. This is what the Java implementation does,
   and this commit brings the .NET implementation into line with that.
 * Updated .NET PhantomJS driver to be able to execute code in the PhantomJS
   context. This allows the user to execute PhantomJS-specific commands using
   the PhantomJS JavaScript API.
 * Updated .NET bindings to use webdriver.json for default Firefox profile.    
   Other language bindings have been using a common JSON file containing the
   default profile setting for the anonymous Firefox profile used by the
   Firefox driver. The .NET bindings now do the same.
 * Now provide an option to hide command prompt window for driver service
   executables (IEDriverServer.exe, chromedriver.exe, etc.) in .NET bindings.
 * Modified to allow user to specify name of driver service executable in .NET.
   We now give an overload to CreateDefaultService for ChromeDriverService,
   PhantomJSDriverService, and InternetExplorerDriverService to allow the
   user to specify the name of the service exectuable. This is particularly
   useful for non-Windows platforms where the executable does not end with
   '.exe'. It also allows the user to rename the executable to a name of
   their choosing and still be able to use it from the .NET bindings.
 * Added a type safe option for IE to use ForceUseShellWindowsApi.
 * Updated .NET ChromeOptions to include latest options for Chrome. Also fixed
   the AddAdditionalCapability method to correctly add additional options to
   the chromeOptions object passed to chromedriver.exe, instead of to the top-
   level of the capabilities object. Adding new top-level capabilities is
   handled by a new overload of AddAdditionalCapability that contains a boolean
   argument to indicate that the capability should be added to the root of the
   capabilities object. This handles the 80% case where new "experimental"
   options are added by the chromedriver team.
 * Implemented FindsBySequence attribute for .NET PageFactory. This new
   attribute allows the user to mark a field or property in a page object such
   that any FindsBy attributes set on the member are used in sequence, as
   specified by the Priority property. Note that when not specifying a Priority
   value, or specifying multiple FindsBy attributes with the same Priority
   value, the behavior is undefined.
 * Fixed cleaning up leftover temp directory when using SafariDriver.

v2.39.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 26 (current), 25 (immediately
   previous), 24 (current ESR), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Deprecated .NET AndroidDriver class. Going forward, the recommended approach
   is to use a third-party implementation for Android, such as Selendroid
   (http://selendroid.io/) or Appium (http://appium.io/).
 * Added experimental IWebDriver extension methods to .NET support classes.
   This commit adds extension methods to IWebDriver, which can be used to
   reduce the amount of type casting that must be done to access
   functionality not provided by the base IWebDriver interface. The following
   methods were added:
    
    * TakeScreenshot() - does not require a cast to ITakesScreenshot, and has
      support for working directly with instances of RemoteWebDriver.
    * ExecuteJavaScript<T>() - does not require a cast to
      IJavaScriptExecutor, and will automatically cast the result to the type
      specified by the generic type parameter (T).
    
   These extension methods should be considered experimental. To use them
   requires a reference to WebDriver.Support.dll, and adding a using clause
   for OpenQA.Selenium.Support.Extensions.

v2.38.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 25 (current), 24 (immediately
   previous and current ESR), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Issue #6383: Adding method GetCSSCount to ISelenium.
 * Issue #6418: Updated .NET path manipulation when launching Firefox process.
 * Issue #6453: Adding type-safe properties for new command-line arguments of
   chromedriver.exe
 * Issue #6457: Disabled keep-alive header on .NET driver service startup/
   shutdown requests.

v2.37.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 24 (current and current ESR),
   23 (immediately previous), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Issue #6163: Refactored .NET DriverService-based shutdown code. Moved
   waiting for the driver service process to end to immediately after sending
   the shutdown HTTP request. Waiting to catch the exception for a failed HTTP
   request due to a closed socket is very expensive. This cuts shutdown time
   for a driver service executable to about 33% of what it used to be for the
   IE driver, with larger savings for Chrome and PhantomJS.

v2.36.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 24 (current and current ESR),
   23 (immediately previous), and 17 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Added ability to set additional ChromeOptions in the .NET bindings. This
   allows the ability to set user profile preferences and local state
   preferences using the ChromeOptions class. The new AddUserProfilePreference
   and AddLocalStatePreference methods correspond to the "prefs" and
   "localState" capabilities documented in the chromedriver documentation. Note
   that the values passed in to these methods must be JSON-serializable, and no
   validation is done on these values at present. We now also allow setting the
   "detach" capability, which allows the user to specify that Chrome remain
   running after chromedriver.exe has quit.
 * Removed support for the obsolete chrome.binary and chrome.switches
   capabilities.
 * Changed the command line arguments to chromedriver.exe to include two
   hyphens, instead of one (e.g., "--silent" instead of "-silent").
 * Issue #6163: Fixed quoting of cmd argument contains space for PhantomJS.
 * Added ability to set Chrome extensions by using base64 encoded strings. 
   Previously, you could only install extensions by using a path to a .crx
   file. Now you can embed the extension as a base64-encoded string, without
   having it persisted to the disk at all.

v2.35.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 23 (current), 22 (immediately
   previous), 17 (current ESR), and 10 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Issue #4506: (on behalf of Aaron Evans) Remove trailing slashes from baseUrl
   in .NET to prevent double slashes in URL. This change is in the .NET
   WebDriverBackedSelenium API.
 * Removed unnecessary ProxyJsonConverter class.
 * Updating InternetExplorerOptions documentation for UsePerProcessProxy
   property.

v2.34.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 22 (current), 21 (immediately
   previous), 17 (current ESR), and 10 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Added support for ie.ensureCleanSession capability to .NET bindings. The
   .NET bindings do this by means of the EnsureCleanSession property on the
   InternetExplorerOptions object. When set to true, this property instructs
   the IE driver to clear the system cache for all instances of Internet
   Explorer, even those already running when the driven instance is launched,
   so care should be used when setting this property. The property defaults to
   false.
 * Added type-safe Proxy property to .NET InternetExplorerOptions class. Also
   added support for the ie.usePerProcessProxy capability via the
   UsePerProcessProxy propery.
 * Issue #5999: Rearranged command line generated for PhantomJS. This
   rearranges the order of arguments so that PhantomJS command line arguments
   appear before the GhostScript main.js file (if any).
 * Added JSON serialization info for .NET Proxy class. Also added Proxy
   property to ChromeOptions class for type-safe adding of proxy to Chrome
   capabilities.
 * Added ability to set external GhostDriver implementation in .NET bindings.
   Previously, it was not possible to set the path to the GhostDriver
   JavaScript implementation in the .NET bindings; the user was forced to use
   the implementation embedded in the PhantomJS executable. This change now
   mimics the Java language bindings in functionality.
 * Moved .NET IE driver command-line args into capabilities. This is to sync up
   the .NET bindings with 2.33.0.7 of IEDriverServer.exe.
 * Allow using global capability types for .NET InternetExplorerOptions.

v2.33.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 21 (current), 20 (immediately
   previous), 17 (current ESR), and 10 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Issue #5549: Modified to use indexer for putting entry in .NET Firefox
   Profile preferences Dictionary. Was previously using the .Add() method of
   the Dictionary, which would throw an exception if the key already existed.
 * Updated InternetExplorerDriverService to allow using new command line
   options for IEDriverServer.exe

v2.32.1
=======
 * Removed strong-naming from released assemblies. No functional changes.

v2.32.0
=======
 * Supports native events for Firefox versions 20 (current), 19 (immediately
   previous), 17 (current ESR), and 10 (immediately previous ESR)
 * Issue #4629: Modified .NET Firefox driver to only look to connect to IPv4
   addresses. The ConnectToBrowser() method always created IPv4 addresses to
   initially addresses for connection, this would throw an exception.
 * Issue #5306: Fixing .NET PageFactory WebElementProxy to call wrapped
   element's FindElements method.
 * Changed FirefoxBinary timeout property to use TimeSpan. Using TimeSpan
   allows more flexibility for the user to set, and does not hard-code
   milliseconds as the unit of measure. This commit introduced overloads of the
   appropriate exposed properties and methods, marking those taking a long as
   obsolete. The obsolete members will be removed in a future version.
 * Do not send chrome.binary capability if the property is null. This will
   properly allow the bindings to start the default Chrome installation when
   using chromedrive2.
 * (on behalf of GeoffMcElhanon) Added support to pass arguments to PhantomJS.
   The PhantomJSDriverService now has type-safe properties for all of the
   command-line switches supported by PhantomJS. These can be passed directly
   on the command line, or can be serialized into a JSON file for passing with
   the --config command line switch to PhantomJS.
 * Removed arbitrary limit on argument types for executing JavaScript.

v2.31.2
=======
 * Issue #5221: Entirely removed the dependency on Castle.Core.dll for .NET
   support library. Using the Castle DynamicProxy has been nothing but a thorn
   in the side of users of WebDriver.Support.dll. This change implements
   hard-coded "proxy" objects the .NET PageFactory implementation. Hopefully,
   this will resolve the issues the PageFactory for everyone. Nevertheless,
   there is every possibility that will entirely break the PageFactory in some
   unforseen way for some subset of users, despite the fact that all of the
   tests (both unit and browser-based tests) pass. If that is the case, feel
   free to file issues, if the issues include code samples that reproduce the
   problem.
 * Fixed .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium NuGet packaging. Package was lacking
   dependencies on other Selenium NuGet packages.

v2.31.1
=======
 * Issue #5257: Fixed assemblies merged with ILMerge on .NET 4.0 when built on
   a machine with .NET 4.5 installed.

v2.31.0
=======
 * Issue #1320: Refactoring .NET Firefox driver's Executable class. The class
   will now better handle custom paths to the Firefox executable.
 * Issue #5160: Fixed .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium wait functions. Wait
   functions in the .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium now will wait until the
   timeout.
 * Issue #5211: Allow extraction of IEDriverServer components to custom
   directory in .NET. The .NET bindings were passing an incorrect command-line
   switch to IEDriverServer.exe for the location to extract embedded library
   files.
 * Introduced new IE attachBrowserTimeout capability to .NET bindings.
 * Blocked ability to set FileDetector for browser-specific drivers in .NET.
   Most of the server-components (chromedriver.exe, IEDriverServer.exe,
   WebDriver Firefox extension) do not understand how to handle the
   FileDetector property. They simply approach all file upload as uploading
   from the local machine. If you need to upload remotely, use an instance of
   the RemoteWebDriver class.

v2.30.0
=======
 * Issue #5032: Fixed .NET FileUtilities.FindFile() to expand environment
   variables and search for invalid characters in PATH directories.
 * Issue #5089: Made connection to Firefox extension locked by socket lock in
   .NET.
 * Issue #5141: Corrected reversed logic in port assignment for .NET
   SafariDriver's WebSocket server.
 * Issue #5177: Now using ILMerge for WebDriver.Support.dll. The support
   library will no longer require an explicit dependency on Castle.Core in its
   NuGet package.
 * Updated .NET dependencies. Json.NET to 4.5r11; Castle.Core to 3.2.0.
 * Added more diagnostics for failed HTTP requests in .NET bindings. This is an
   attempt to help diagnose the root cause of issue #3719. Please note that it
   makes no effort whatsoever to "fix" the issue. This is simply hoping to 
   provide more information for those who have run into that issue, and see if
   all occurrances have the same root cause.
 * Only adding environment variables for Firefox process if they do not already
   exist.
 * Properly passing requireWindowFocus capability when set in .NET bindings.
   Previously, this capability could be set in InternetExplorerOptions, but
   it was not being passed through to the driver session.
 * Deprecated Alert property of UnhandledAlertException in favor of AlertText
   property.
 * Updated .NET bindings to use embedded Safari extension. Separate extension
   build and installation no longer required.
 * Updated registry search for Firefox executable in the .NET bindings.

v2.29.1
=======
 * Rebuilt to get embedded Firefox extension with correct version. The
   extension in 2.29.0 had a version of "2.28" instead of "2.29". This has now
   been corrected.

v2.29.0
=======
 * Implemented use with lists for the FindsByAttribute in the .NET bindings.
   Note that fields and properties decorated with the FindsBy attribute must be
   either IWebElement or IList<IWebElement>.
 * Exposed RequireWindowFocus option for Internet Explorer driver in .NET
   bindings. This is still an experimental feature, and should be used with
   extreme care.
 * Added guard for EnablePersistentHoverCapability in .NET
   InternetExplorerOptions.AddAdditionalCapability().
 * Added type safe ability via InternetExplorerOptions to enable/disable the
   persistent hover capability in the .NET bindings for the IE driver.

v2.28.0
=======
 * Introduced the CustomFinderType property to the .NET FindsByAttribute. This
   allows use of custom By subclasses in the PageFactory. The custom finder
   must be a subclass of By, and it must expose a public constructor that takes
   a string argument. To use a custom finder with the FindsByAttribute, use the
   following syntax:

       [FindsBy(How = How.Custom, 
                Using = "customCriteria", 
                CustomFinderType = typeof(MyCustomBySubclass))]

   Using How.Custom without specifying a CustomFinderType, or using a
   CustomFinderType that either does not descend from By or does not have a 
   proper constructor will throw an exception.

v2.27.1
=======
 * Corrected FileUtilities.FindFile() to correctly return the current directory
   if the specified file is located there. This fixes an issue where driver
   service executables (IEDriverServer.exe and chromedriver.exe) would not be
   found if placed in the same directory as the WebDriver.dll assembly,
   breaking previous behavior.
   
v2.27.0
=======
 * Issues #3508 and #2103: Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered by
   onchange of <select> elements or by onsubmit of <form> elements.
 * Issue #4865: Changed DesiredCapabilities.Safari() to return
   DesiredCapabilities instead of ICapabilities.
 * Implemented rudimentary path searching for executable-based drivers (such
   as IE, Chrome, and PhantomJS).
 * Finally made the .NET PhantomJSDriver public. It still requires a PhantomJS
   built from the trunk of that project, at least until PhantomJS 1.8 is
   released in late December.
 * Implemented touch screen actions for the .NET bindings.
 * Added ability to add experimental or additional capabilities for which there
   are not yet type safe options to the .NET InternetExplorerOptions and
   ChromeOptions classes.
 * Removed necessity for path to GhostDriver's main.js for the .NET
   PhantomJSDriverService in favor of a command line switch (GhostDriver is now
   internal to PhantomJS).
 * Turned off use of the Expect-100 header for the HttpWebRequests.
 * Added various StyleCop changes.
 * Added support for file uploads to a remote WebDriver server.
 * Added a missing method to the Actions API.

v2.26.0
=======
 * Issue #4526: Bumping .NET HttpWebRequest service point connection limit to
   2000.
 * Prevent firefox from updating, checking and warning for extension and plugin
   updates
 * Handled the case where a JSON Wire Protocol error response contains a null
   value for the message property. Also guarded against null values in other 
   members of the error response.
 * Added .NET implementation of PhantomJSDriver, as a headless option for .NET
   users. This driver requires PhantomJS and GhostDriver. Since the GhostDriver
   project isn't ready to be used just yet, these classes are marked with 
   "internal" visibility. When the GhostDriver project is ready, these classes
   will be made public. Also including test enhancements for use with 
   PhantomJS.
 * Made keep-alive configurable on .NET HttpCommandExecutor and
   DriverServiceCommandExecutor.
 * Shortcut trying to convert element to ILocatable if an Action in the .NET
   bindings is called specifically with a null value for element.
 * Added the LibraryExtractionPath propery to InternetExplorerDriverService to
   be able to set the location to which the support library of the
   IEDriverServer.exe is extracted. 
 * Implementing SuppressInitialDiagnosticInformation property on DriverService
   to allow users of standalone driver servers to suppress the display of the
   initial information from the console via the -silent switch.
 * Updated .NET Actions class to accept IWebDriver objects that implement
   IWrapsDriver as well as IHasInputDevices. Similarly, actions now can take
   IWebElement objects that implement IWrapsElement as well as ILocatable. This
   allows the use of EventFiringWebDriver objects directly without casting in
   end-user code.
 * Changing the disposal semantics of the .NET bindings to more closely match
   the .NET Framework disposal semantics. This means that calling Dispose() on
   a driver is equivalent to calling Quit(), which enables usage of the using()
   construct.
 * Replaced throwing of System.TimeoutException with throwing
   WebDriverTimeoutException, which now descends from WebDriverException.
 * Added .NET InternetExplorerOptions.UnexpectedAlertBehavior property to
   specify how unexpected alerts are handled by the IE driver.
 * Updated the .NET deployment build to use ILMerge, which merges the dependent
   assemblies into the main WebDriver.dll assembly. This also removes
   dependencies on NuGet packages for the core WebDriver.dll assembly.
 * Updated .NET UnhandledAlertException to include a reference to the Alert not
   handled.
 * Expose setting the port for DriverService-based drivers.
 * Removed visibility of Finder property for FindsByAttribute. This will never
   work because of .NET's rules around attribute parameter types.
 * Made .NET 4.0 the default of the .NET bindings for development and
   debugging.
 * Updated constructor to .NET Actions class to check that driver parameter
   implements IHasInputDevices.

v2.25.1
=======
 * Updated InternetExplorerOptions to allow users to set the IgnoreZoomLevel
   setting.
 * Exposed constructors in ChromeDriver and InternetExplorerDriver that allow
   passing a DriverService object. This gives the user more control over the
   properties of the DriverService.
 * Updated exception thrown by .NET SafariDriver when a connection to the 
   driver is not created within 45 seconds.
 * Cleaned up documentation comment warning on build of the .NET implementation
   of WebDriverBackedSelenium.

v2.25.0
=======
 * Updated Json.NET version to 4.5r7. Also changing NuGet packaging to no
   longer rely on specific package version of dependencies.
 * Updated FxCop/StyleCop global warning suppressions file.
 * Updated InternetExplorerDriverService to be able to manipulate the command
   line switches using strongly-typed properties of the object.
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align 
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1. This commit
   includes an addition to the InternetExplorerOptions of the .NET bindings.
 * Fixed element finding and table handling in .NET WebDriverBackedSelenium.

v2.24.0
=======
 * Issue #4070: Updated OpenQA.Selenium.Support.PageObjects.FindsByAttribute so
   that overridden operators correctly handle the null case.

v2.23.0
=======
 * Removed the embedded IE server from the .NET bindings. From now on, you 
   *must* use the IE standalone server with .NET.
 * Removed unneeded polling for parent.lock file on anonymous Firefox profile
   in temp directory.

v2.22.1
=======
 * Issue #4015: Not all browser driver implementations understand the generic
   set timeouts HTTP endpoint of the JSON wire protocol, instead responding to
   the deprecated specific endpoints for each timeout.

v2.22.0
=======
 * Issue #3242: Added Android to Platform enumeration.
 * Issue #3870 (code supplied by KellySummerlin): Added ByChained support to
   the WebDriver.Support assembly. Also created  additions to the .NET
   PageFactory to allow decorating members with multiple instances of
   FindsByAttribute, including ordering of the attributes.
 * The .NET IE driver implementation now looks for the IE standalone server. 
   Please note that if you do not set the option in InternetExplorerOptions
   to use the legacy server, the constructor *will* throw an exception. There 
   is no automatic fallback to using the embedded .dll, because there's no 
   standard way in the .NET framework to alert the user to a condition that 
   needs attention at runtime, and guarantee it will be seen.
 * Implemented ability to set page load timeout in the .NET bindings.
 * Added tests to .NET bindings to align more closely with Java.
 * Updated .NET bindings InternetExplorerOptions to allow the user to disable
   native events for IE. Note that actually doing this is not recommended as of
   this release.
 * Added .NET version of LoadableComponent and SlowLoadableComponent to the
   WebDriver.Support assembly (code supplied by KellySummerlin).
 * Trivially refactored the constructors of "service-based" drivers for .NET
   bindings.
 * Made .NET unit tests more friendly to non-Windows operating systems (using
   Mono).
 * Updated .NET Safari driver to conform to the new message format in r16716.
 * Implemented an InitialBrowserUrl property in InternetExplorerOptions to
   allow the user to customize the page loaded when IE launches. This can be 
   used in conjunction with IntroduceInstabilityByIgnoringProtectedModeSettings
   property to set the initial Protected Mode zone of the browser. However,
   this is still by far a second-best choice, and the first choice should 
   *always* be to actually set the Protected Mode settings of each zone. If a 
   user is using this property, only a "best effort" at support will be given.
 * Allow user-defined installation path for Safari in the SafariDriver.
 * Changed .NET DesiredCapabilities.Android() to correctly assign a platform 
   value of Android.

v2.21.0
=======
 * Issue #3329: Fixed .NET EventFiring WebDriver to switch to a frame using the
   wrapped element.
 * Updated NoSuchFrameException, NoSuchWindowException, and
   NoAlertPresentException to properly descend from NotFoundException
   in the .NET bindings.
 * Modifying .NET PageFactory so that elements marked with the FindBy 
   attribute can be used with the interactions API.
 * Updated Json.NET dependency to 4.5r1 and NuGet.exe to 1.7.
 * Changed the name of the standalone IE driver server from 
   InternetExplorerDriver.exe to IEDriverServer.exe
 * Removed recently added restore window command from .NET bindings.
 * Extracted FindFreePort method in .NET to a common utility class.
 * Landed the .NET SafariDriver. Woot!
 * Added a WebSocket server implementation.
 * Implemented window maximize and restore WebDriver commands for the .NET
   bindings.
 * Fixed .NET FirefoxExtension to allow for parallel installation of extensions
   into profiles being run by parallel tests.
 * Fixed .NET RemoteWebDriver to translate a single null deliberately passed in
   as a script arg into an arg array containing the null.
 * Upped service point connection limit for Selenium RC command processor
 * Removed deprecated constructors on .NET bindings InternetExplorerDriver

v2.20.0
=======
 * No changes specific to the .NET bindings.

v2.19.0
=======
 * No changes specific to the .NET bindings.

v2.18.1
=======
 * NuGet dependency release. No functional changes to the project.

v2.18.0
=======
 * Updated .NET WebDriver.Support assembly to depend on Castle Windsor 3.0
 * Updated to JSON.NET to 4.0r6
 * Refactored ChromeDriverService to be a subclass of a base DriverService 
   class, designed to allow any JSON Wire Protocol-compliant standalone server
   executable to be used as a service. This adds all required work for the 
   .NET bindings to begin using the standalone IE remote server.
 * Enable CODE_ANALYSIS flag for Debug builds so that standalone FxCop can
   take advantage of GlobalSuppressions.cs.
 * Added help text to the exception message for WebDriverBackedSelenium, in
   the case that the Start() method has not been called on the instance.

v2.17.0
=======
 * Issue #3172: Updated the .NET PageFactory to traverse the inheritance tree
   to find custom attributes.
 * Reverted the .NET remote Command object to return an empty string
   instead of an empty JSON object ("{}") when the command has no parameters.
 * Introduced ChromeOptions class for use with the ChromeDriver. This makes
   obsolete calling constructors on ChromeDriver that take an ICapabilities
   object.
 * Added toolkit.telemetry.enabled and toolkit.telemetry.rejected to the
   default profile used by the FirefoxDriver.

v2.16.0
=======
 * Made By, Cookie and Screenshot .NET classes serializable.
 * Slightly modifying build output to be more informative when building
   .NET bindings from within the Visual Studio IDE.
 * Explicitly setting socket.ExclusiveAddressUse = true when attempting to 
   find a free port for the .NET bindings' FirefoxDriver.
 * Updating the .NET remote Command object to return an empty JSON object 
   ("{}") instead of an empty string when the command has no parameters.
 * Implementing the /sessions and /status commands for the IE driver and the
   .NET bindings.
 * Check elements' internal IDs for equality before making RPC call to 
   determine IWebElement equality in .NET.
 * Removed unused JSON wire protocol command values from the .NET bindings.

v2.15.0
=======
 * Added support for window positioning and sizing API to IE.
 * Introduced DefaultWait class to WebDriver.Support assembly, to allow fully
   configurable waits.
 * Added IRotatable interface for driving client browsers supporting rotation.
 * Introduced experimental ExpectedConditions class to WebDriver.Support
   assembly, providing methods to use to wait for commonly-experienced
   conditions.

v2.14.0
=======
 * Implemented iPad desired capability.
 * Updated Json.NET version to 4.0r4

v2.13.0
=======
 * Do not use "which" to find Firefox on Windows in the .NET bindings.
 * Pass '-foreground' to the firefox binary. Ensures focus by default on OS X.

v2.12.0
=======
 * Added experimental IWindow interface for controling size and position of
   browser windows.

v2.11.0
=======
 * Updated to be consistent with other language bindings. Change to java
   server to allow use of safariproxy driver type. No functional changes.

v2.10.0
=======
 * Added "extensions.autoDisableScopes" to default Firefox profile
 * Removes the deprecated SendModifierKey command, replacing it with
   SendKeysToActiveElement
 * Added IntroduceInstabilityByIgnoringProtectedModeSettings to
   InternetExplorerDriver to make setting capabilities easier when
   bypassing the Protected Mode settings check of the IE driver

v2.9.0
======
  * Look up private parent fields when using the support classes PageFactory.
  * Preparing RemoteWebDriver to understand upcoming URI changes to JSON wire
  * protocol.

v2.8.0
======
  * Added interactions methods for .Release(), ClickAndHold(), and 
    DoubleClick() which take no arguments
  * Added ClickAt() implementation in WebDriverBackedSelenium

v2.7.0
======
  * No functional changes

v2.6.0
======
  * Issue 2349: Fixed memory leak in PageFactory
  * Issue 2356: Fixed P/Invoke signatures for native .NET 4.0 projects
  * Issue 2385: Added protected AddAction method on Actions class to allow
    subclasses to insert IAction implementations into action chain.
  * Disabled Firefox profile setting "browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled" by
    default

v2.5.1
======
  * No functional changes, providing .NET 4.0 binaries and updates to NuGet
    packaging only.

v2.5.0
======
  * Bringing .NET SelectElement support class in line with Java Select class
  * WebDriver.SwitchTo().Alert() now throws an exception when no alert present.
  * InvalidSelectorException now thrown when XPath selector syntax is
    incorrect.

v2.4.1
======
  * No functional changes, updates to NuGet packaging only.

v2.4.0
======
  * Adding InvalidSelector error code.
  * Default to field/property name if no Using is specified in PageFactory.
  * Replaced reference to Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll with Ionic.Zip.dll to match up
    NuGet packages.

v2.3.0
======
  * Added protected constructors and properties to make it easier to subclass
    By for custom element finders.

v2.2.0
======
  * Adding first pass at .NET implementation of proxy management.
  * Modifying .NET build process to sign assemblies. Building the .NET bindings
    through the IDE or through the command line will now produce signed
	assemblies.
  * Updating .NET bindings JSON.NET from 3.5 to 4.0.
