  ❗️ It seems this issue is not using any of the supported templates


  💡 Supported issue types are (they start with):


  * 🐛 Bug Report (bugs found in a recent release)

  * 🚀 Feature Proposal (a useful feature you would like to propose)

  * 💥 Regression Report (a supported feature is not working anymore)


  Issue templates help this project to stay in shape, please use them and fill them out completely.
  By doing that you are helping the project because the community and maintainers can provide prompt feedback,
  and potentially solve the issue.
