                If the issue is a question, add the <code>I-question</code> label.

              <p>
                If the issue requires changes or fixes from an external project (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, MSEdgeDriver, W3C),
               add the applicable <code>G-*</code> label, and it will provide the correct link and auto-close the
               issue.
              </p>
