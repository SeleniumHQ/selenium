## v4.0.0-alpha.1

### Notice

*  The minimum supported version of Node is now 8.9.0 LTS

### Changes to Supported Browsers

Native support has been removed for Opera and PhantomJS as the WebDriver
implementations for these browsers are no longer under active development.

For Opera, users should be able to simply rely on testing Chrome as the Opera
browser is based on Chromium (and the operadriver was a thin wrapper around
chromedriver). For PhantomJS, users should use Chrome or Firefox in headless
mode (see `example/headless.js`)

### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

*  Revamped the actions API to conform with the WebDriver Spec:
   <https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#actions>. For details, refer to the JS doc
   on the `lib/input.Actions` class.

   As of January, 2018, only Firefox natively supports this new API. You can
   put the `Actions` class into "bridge mode" and it will attempt to translate
   mouse and keyboard actions to the legacy API (see class docs). Alternatively,
   you may continue to use the legacy API directly via the `lib/actions` module.
   __NOTE:__ The legacy API is considered strongly deprecated and will be
   removed in a minor release once Google's Chrome and Microsoft's Edge browsers
   support the new API.

*  All window manipulation commands are now supported.
*  Added `driver.switchTo().parentFrame()`
*  When a named cookie is requested, attempt to fetch it directly using the
   W3C endpoint, `GET /session/{session id}/cookie/{name}`. If this command is
   not recognized by the remote end, fallback to fetching all cookies and then
   searching for the desired name.
*  Replaced `WebElement.getSize()` and `WebElement.getLocation()` with a single
   method, `WebElement.getRect()`.

### API Changes

*  The core WebDriver API no longer uses promise manager
   -  Removed `index.Builder#setControlFlow()`
   -  The following thenable types no longer have a `cancel()` method:
     -  The dynamically generated thenable WebDrivers created by `index.Builder`
     -  `lib/webdriver.AlertPromise`
     -  `lib/webdriver.WebElementPromise`
*  Removed `remote/index.DriverService.prototype.stop()` (use `#kill()` instead)
*  Removed the `lib/actions` module
*  Removed the `lib/events` module
*  Removed the `phantomjs` module
*  Removed the 'opera' module
*  Removed the promise manager from `lib/promise`, which includes the removal
   of the following exported names (replacements, if any, in parentheses):
   -  CancellableThenable
   -  CancellationError
   -  ControlFlow
   -  Deferred
   -  LONG_STACK_TRACES
   -  MultipleUnhandledRejectionError
   -  Promise (use native Promises)
   -  Resolver
   -  Scheduler
   -  Thenable
   -  USE_PROMISE_MANAGER
   -  all (use Promise.all)
   -  asap (use Promise.resolve)
   -  captureStackTrace (use Error.captureStackTrace)
   -  consume (use async functions)
   -  controlFlow
   -  createPromise (use new Promise)
   -  defer
   -  fulfilled (use Promise.resolve)
   -  isGenerator
   -  rejected (use Promise.reject)
   -  setDefaultFlow
   -  when (use Promise.resolve)
*  Changes to the `Builder` class:
   -  Added setChromeService, setEdgeService, & setFirefoxService
   -  Removed setEnableNativeEvents
   -  Removed setScrollBehavior
*  Changes to `chrome.Driver`
   -  Added sendDevToolsCommand
   -  Added setDownloadPath
*  Changes to `chrome.Options`
   -  Now extends the `Capabilities` class
   -  Removed from/toCapabilities
*  Changes to `edge.Options`
   -  Now extends the `Capabilities` class
   -  Removed from/toCapabilities
*  Changes to `ie.Options`
   -  Now extends the `Capabilities` class
   -  Removed from/toCapabilities
*  Removed the `firefox.Binary` class. Custom binaries can still be selected
   using `firefox.Options#setBinary()`. Likewise, custom binary arguments can be
   specified with `firefox.Options#addArguments()`.
*  Changes to `firefox.Driver`
   -  Added installAddon(path)
   -  Added uninstallAddon(id)
*  Changes to `firefox.Options`
   -  Now extends the `Capabilities` class
   -  Removed from/toCapabilities
   -  Removed setLoggingPreferences (was a no-op)
   -  setProfile now only accepts a path to an existing profile
   -  Added addExtensions
   -  Added setPreference
*  Removed the `firefox.Profile` class. All of its functionality is now
   provided directly by `firefox.Options`
*  Removed the `firefox/binary` module
*  Removed the `firefox/profile` module
*  Changes to `safari.Options`
   -  Now extends the `Capabilities` class
   -  Removed from/toCapabilities
   -  Removed setCleanSession (was a no-op)
*  Changes to `lib/capabilities.Browser`:
   -  Removed several enum values.
      -  ANDROID (use Chrome for Android; see docs on the chrome module)
      -  IPAD (no support available)
      -  IPHONE (no support available)
      -  OPERA (use Chrome)
      -  PHANTOM_JS (use Chrome or Firefox in headless mode)
      -  HTMLUNIT (use Chrome or Firefox in headless mode)
*  Changes to `lib/capabilities.Capabilities`:
   -  Removed static factory methods android(), ipad(), iphone(), opera(),
      phantomjs(), htmlunit(), and htmlunitwithjs(). Users can still manually
      configure capabilities for these, but their use is not recommended and
      they will no longer be surfaced in the API.
*  Changes to `lib/error`:
   -   Added
       -   ElementClickInterceptedError
       -   InsecureCertificateError
       -   InvalidCoordinatesError
       -   NoSuchCookieError
   -   Removed
       -  ElementNotVisibleError
       -  InvalidElementCoordinatesError
*  Changes to `lib/webdriver.WebDriver`:
   -  Dropped support for "requiredCapabilities" from WebDriver.createSession
   -  actions() now returns the new `lib/input.Actions` class
   -  Removed touchActions
   -  Renamed schedule to execute
   -  Removed the `WebDriver.attachToSession()` factory method. Users can just
      the `WebDriver` constructor directly instead.
   -  Removed the `call()` method. This was used to inject custom function calls
      into the control flow. Now that the promise manager is no longer used,
      this method is no longer necessary. Users are now responsible for
      coordinating actions (ideally with async functions) and can just call
      functions directly instead of through `driver.call()`.
*  Changes to `lib/webdriver.WebElement`:
   -  Replaced getSize & getLocation with getRect
*  Changes to `lib/webdriver.Alert`:
   -  Removed authenticateAs
*  Changes to `lib/webdriver.Options` (`driver.manage()`):
   -  Removed timeouts (use get/setTimeouts)
*  Changes to `lib/webdriver.Window` (`driver.manage().window()`):
   -   Added
       -  getRect
       -  setRect
       -  fullscreen
       -  minimize
   -   Removed (use the getRect/setRect methods)
       -  getPosition
       -  setPosition
       -  getSize
       -  setSize
*  Removed the `testing/assert` module
*  Changes to `testing/index`
   -  Since the promise manager has been removed, it is no longer necessary to
      wrap the Mocha test hooks; instead, users can simply use async functions.
      The following have all been removed:
      -  describe
      -  before
      -  beforeEach
      -  after
      -  afterEach
      -  it
   -  Added the `suite` function. For details, refer to the jsdoc or
      `example/google_search_test.js`



## v3.6.0

### Bug Fixes

* The Capabilities factory methods should only specify the name of the browser.
* Protect against the remote end sometimes not returning a list to findElements
  commands.
* Properly reset state in `remote.DriverService#kill()`
* The firefox module will no longer apply the preferences required by the legacy
  FirefoxDriver. These preferences were only required when using the legacy
  driver, support for which was dropped in v3.5.0.

### API Changes

* Added new methods to `selenium-webdriver/firefox.Options`:
  - addArguments()
  - headless()
  - windowSize()
* Deprecated `selenium-webdriver/firefox/binary.Binary`
* Removed `selenium-webdriver/firefox.Options#useGeckoDriver()`
* Removed the unused `selenium-webdriver/firefox/profile.decode()`
* Removed methods from `selenium-webdriver/firefox/profile.Profile` that had
  no effect since support for the legacy FirefoxDriver was dropped in 3.5.0:
  - setNativeEventsEnabled
  - nativeEventsEnabled
  - getPort
  - setPort
* Removed `selenium-webdriver/firefox.ServiceBuilder#setFirefoxBinary()`; custom
  binaries should be configured through the `firefox.Options` class.
* Removed `selenium-webdriver/firefox.Capability`. These hold overs from the
  legacy FirefoxDriver are no longer supported.

### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

* Deprecated `error.ElementNotVisibleError` in favor of the more generic
  `error.ElementNotInteractableError`.
* Support the `httpOnly` option when adding a cookie.


## v3.5.0

### Notice

Native support for Firefox 45 (ESR) has been removed. Users will have to connect
to a remote Selenium server that supports Firefox 45.

### Changes

* Removed native support for Firefox 46 and older.
  - The `SELENIUM_MARIONETTE` enviornment variable no longer has an effect.
  - `selenium-webdriver/firefox.Capability.MARIONETTE` is deprecated.
  - `selenium-webdriver/firefox.Options#useGeckoDriver()` is deprecated and now a no-op.
* `firefox.Options` will no longer discard the `"moz:firefoxOptions"` set in
  user provided capabilities (via `Builder.withCapabilities({})`). When both
  are used, the settings in `firefox.Options` will be applied _last_.
* Added `chrome.Options#headless()` and `chrome.Options#windowSize()`, which
  may be used to start Chrome in headless mode (requires Chrome 59+) and to set
  the initial window size, respectively.


### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

* Added `error.WebDriverError#remoteStacktrace` to capture the stacktrace
  reported by a remote WebDriver endpoint (if any).
* Fixed `WebElement#sendKeys` to send text as a string instead of an array of
  strings.

## v3.4.0

### Notice

This release requires [geckodriver 0.15.0](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.15.0) or newer.

### API Changes

* Added `Options#getTimeouts()` for retrieving the currently configured session
  timeouts (i.e. implicit wait). This method will only work with W3C compatible
  WebDriver implementations.
* Deprecated the `Timeouts` class in favor of `Options#setTimeouts()`, which
  supports setting multiple timeouts at once.
* Added support for emulating different network conditions (e.g., offline, 2G, WiFi) on Chrome.

### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

* Fixed W3C response parsing, which expects response data to always be a JSON
  object with a `value` key.
* Added W3C endpoints for interacting with various types of
  [user prompts](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#user-prompts).
* Added W3C endpoints for remotely executing scripts.
* Added W3C endpoints to get current window handle and all windows handles.


## v3.3.0

* Added warning log messages when the user creates new managed promises, or
  schedules unchained tasks. Users may opt in to printing these log messages
  with

  ```js
  const {logging} = require('selenium-webdriver');
  logging.installConsoleHandler();
  logging.getLogger('promise.ControlFlow').setLevel(logging.Level.WARNING);
  ```
* If the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set, use it to locate java.exe.


## v3.2.0

* Release skipped to stay in sync with the main Selenium project.


## v3.1.0

* The `lib` package is once again platform agnostic (excluding `lib/devmode`).
* Deprecated `promise.when(value, callback, errback)`.
  Use `promise.fulfilled(value).then(callback, errback)`
* Changed `promise.fulfilled(value)`, `promise.rejected(reason)` and
  `promise.defer()` to all use native promises when the promise manager is
  disabled.
* Properly handle W3C error responses to new session commands.
* Updated `selenium-webdriver/testing` to export `describe.only` along with
  `describe.skip`.
* Fixed `selenium-webdriver/lib/until.ableToSwitchToFrame`. It was previously
  dropping arguments and would never work.
* Added the ability to use Firefox Nightly
* If Firefox cannot be found in the default location, look for it on the PATH
* Allow SafariDriver to use Safari Technology Preview.
* Use the proper wire command for WebElement.getLocation() and
  WebElement.getSize() for W3C compliant drivers.


## v3.0.1

* More API adjustments to align with native Promises
  - Deprecated `promise.fulfilled(value)`, use `promise.Promise#resolve(value)`
  - Deprecated `promise.rejected(reason)`, use `promise.Promise#reject(reason)`
* When a `wait()` condition times out, the returned promise will now be
  rejected with an `error.TimeoutError` instead of a generic `Error` object.
* `WebDriver#wait()` will now throw a TypeError if an invalid wait condition is
  provided.
* Properly catch unhandled promise rejections with an action sequence (only
  impacts when the promise manager is disabled).


## v3.0.0

* (__NOTICE__) The minimum supported version of Node is now 6.9.0 LTS
* Removed support for the SafariDriver browser extension. This has been
  replaced by Apple's safaridriver, which is included wtih Safari 10
  (available on OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra).

  To use Safari 9 or older, users will have to use an older version of Selenium.

* geckodriver v0.11.0 or newer is now required for Firefox.
* Fixed potential reference errors in `selenium-webdriver/testing` when users
  create a cycle with mocha by running with mocha's `--hook` flag.
* Fixed `WebDriver.switchTo().activeElement()` to use the correct HTTP method
  for compatibility with the W3C spec.
* Update the `selenium-webdriver/firefox` module to use geckodriver's
  "moz:firefoxOptions" dictionary for Firefox-specific configuration values.
* Extending the `selenium-webdriver/testing` module to support tests defined
  using generator functions.
* The promise manager can be disabled by setting an enviornment variable:
  `SELENIUM_PROMISE_MANAGER=0`. This is part of a larger plan to remove the
  promise manager, as documented at
  <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/2969>
* When communicating with a W3C-compliant remote end, use the atoms library for
  the `WebElement.getAttribute()` and `WebElement.isDisplayed()` commands. This
  behavior is consistent with the java, .net, python, and ruby clients.


### API Changes

 * Removed `safari.Options#useLegacyDriver()`
 * Reduced the API on `promise.Thenable` for compatibility with native promises:
   - Removed `#isPending()`
   - Removed `#cancel()`
   - Removed `#finally()`
 * Changed all subclasses of `webdriver.WebDriver` to overload the static
   function `WebDriver.createSession()` instead of doing work in the
   constructor. All constructors now inherit the base class' function signature.
   Users are still encouraged to use the `Builder` class instead of creating
   drivers directly.
 * `Builder#build()` now returns a "thenable" WebDriver instance, allowing users
   to immediately schedule commands (as before), or issue them through standard
   promise callbacks. This is the same pattern already employed for WebElements.
 * Removed `Builder#buildAsync()` as it was redundant with the new semantics of
   `build()`.



## v3.0.0-beta-3

* Fixed a bug where the promise manager would silently drop callbacks after
  recovering from an unhandled promise rejection.
* Added the `firefox.ServiceBuilder` class, which may be used to customize the
  geckodriver used for `firefox.Driver` instances.
* Added support for Safari 10 safaridriver. safaridriver may be disabled
  via tha API, `safari.Options#useLegacyDriver`, to use the safari
  extension driver.
* Updated the `lib/proxy` module to support configuring a SOCKS proxy.
* For the `promise.ControlFlow`, fire the "uncaughtException" event in a new
  turn of the JS event loop. As a result of this change, any errors thrown by
  an event listener will propagate to the global error handler. Previously,
  this event was fired with in the context of a (native) promise callback,
  causing errors to be silently suppressed in the promise chain.

### API Changes

* Added `remote.DriverService.Builder` as a base class for configuring
  DriverService instances that run in a child-process. The
  `chrome.ServiceBuilder`, `edge.ServiceBuilder`, and `opera.ServiceBuilder`
  classes now all extend this base class with browser-specific options.
* For each of the ServiceBuilder clases, renamed `usingPort` and
  `withEnvironment` to `setPort` and `setEnvironment`, respectively.
* Renamed `chrome.ServiceBuilder#setUrlBasePath` to `#setPath`
* Changed the signature of the `firefox.Driver` from `(config, flow, executor)`
  to `(config, executor, flow)`.
* Exposed the `Condition` and `WebElementCondition` classes from the top-level
  `selenium-webdriver` module (these were previously only available from
  `lib/webdriver`).


### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

* Updated command mappings for [getting](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#get-window-position)
  and [setting](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#set-window-position)
  the window position.


## v3.0.0-beta-2

### API Changes

* Moved the `builder.Builder` class into the main module (`selenium-webdriver`).
* Removed the `builder` module.
* Fix `webdriver.WebDriver#setFileDetector` when driving Chrome or Firefox on a
  remote machine.


## v3.0.0-beta-1

* Allow users to set the agent used for HTTP connections through
   `builder.Builder#usingHttpAgent()`
* Added new wait conditions: `until.urlIs()`, `until.urlContains()`,
   `until.urlMatches()`
* Added work around for [GeckoDriver bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1274924)
   raising a type conversion error
* Internal cleanup replacing uses of managed promises with native promises
* Removed the mandatory use of Firefox Dev Edition, when using Marionette driver
* Fixed timeouts' URL
* Properly send HTTP requests when using a WebDriver server proxy
* Properly configure proxies when using the geckodriver
* `http.Executor` now accepts a promised client. The `builder.Builder` class
  will now use this instead of a `command.DeferredExecutor` when creating
  WebDriver instances.
* For Chrome and Firefox, the `builder.Builder` class will always return an
  instanceof `chrome.Driver` and `firefox.Driver`, respectively, even when
  configured to use a remote server (from `builder.Builder#usingServer(url)`,
  `SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL`, etc).

### API Changes

* `promise.Deferred` is no longer a thenable object.
* `Options#addCookie()` now takes a record object instead of 7 individual
  parameters. A TypeError will be thrown if addCookie() is called with invalid
  arguments.
* When adding cookies, the desired expiry must be provided as a Date or in
  _seconds_ since epoch. When retrieving cookies, the expiration is always
  returned in seconds.
* Renamed `firefox.Options#useMarionette` to `firefox.Options#useGeckoDriver`
* Removed deprecated modules:
   - `selenium-webdriver/error` (use `selenium-webdriver/lib/error`,\
     or the `error` property exported by `selenium-webdriver`)
   - `selenium-webdriver/executors` — this was not previously deprecated, but
     is no longer used.
* Removed deprecated types:
   - `command.DeferredExecutor` — this was not previously deprecated, but is no
     longer used. It can be trivially implemented by clients should it be
     needed.
   - `error.InvalidSessionIdError` (use `error.NoSuchSessionError`)
   - `executors.DeferredExecutor`
   - `until.Condition` (use `webdriver.Condition`)
   - `until.WebElementCondition` (use `webdriver.WebElementCondition`)
   - `webdriver.UnhandledAlertError` (use `error.UnexpectedAlertOpenError`)
* Removed deprecated functions:
   - `Deferred#cancel()`
   - `Deferred#catch()`
   - `Deferred#finally()`
   - `Deferred#isPending()`
   - `Deferred#then()`
   - `Promise#thenCatch()`
   - `Promise#thenFinally()`
   - `WebDriver#isElementPresent()`
   - `WebElement#getInnerHtml()`
   - `WebElement#getOuterHtml()`
   - `WebElement#getRawId()`
   - `WebElement#isElementPresent()`
* Removed deprecated properties:
   - `WebDriverError#code`


## v2.53.2

* Changed `io.exists()` to return a rejected promise if the input path is not
   a string
* Deprecated `Promise#thenFinally()` - use `Promise#finally()`. The thenFinally
   shim added to the promise module in v2.53.0 will be removed in v3.0
   Sorry for the churn!
* FIXED: capabilities serialization now properly handles undefined vs.
   false-like values.
* FIXED: properly handle responses from the remote end in
   `WebDriver.attachToSession`

## v2.53.1

* FIXED: for consistency with the other language bindings, `remote.FileDetector`
    will ignore paths that refer to a directory.

## v2.53.0

### Change Summary

* Added preliminary support for Marionette, Mozilla's WebDriver implementation
   for Firefox. Marionette may be enabled via the API,
   `firefox.Options#useMarionette`, or by setting the `SELENIUM_MARIONETTE`
   environment variable.
* Moved all logic for parsing and interpreting responses from the remote end
   into the individual `command.Executor` implementations.
* For consistency with the other Selenium language bindings,
   `WebDriver#isElementPresent()` and `WebElement#isElementPresent()` have
   been deprecated. These methods will be removed in v3.0. Use the findElements
   command to test for the presence of an element:

      driver.findElements(By.css('.foo')).then(found => !!found.length);
* Added support for W3C-spec compliant servers.
* For consistent naming, deprecating `error.InvalidSessionIdError` in favor of
    `error.NoSuchSessionError`.
* Moved the `error` module to `lib/error` so all core modules are co-located.
   The top-level `error` module will be removed in v3.0.
* Moved `until.Condition` and `until.WebElementCondition` to the webdriver
   module to break a circular dependency.
* Added support for setting the username and password in basic auth pop-up
   dialogs (currently IE only).
* Deprecated `WebElement#getInnerHtml()` and `WebEleemnt#getOuterHtml()`
* Deprecated `Promise#thenCatch()` - use `Promise#catch()` instead
* Deprecated `Promise#thenFinally()` - use `promise.thenFinally()` instead
* FIXED: `io.findInPath()` will no longer match against directories that have
   the same basename as the target file.
* FIXED: `phantomjs.Driver` now takes a third argument that defines the path to
   a log file to use for the phantomjs executable's output. This may be quickly
   set at runtime with the `SELENIUM_PHANTOMJS_LOG` environment variable.

### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

* Changed `element.sendKeys(...)` to send the key sequence as an array where
   each element defines a single key. The legacy wire protocol permits arrays
   where each element is a string of arbitrary length. This change is solely
   at the protocol level and should have no user-visible effect.


## v2.52.0

### Notice

Starting with v2.52.0, each release of selenium-webdriver will support the
latest _minor_ LTS and stable Node releases. All releases between the LTS and
stable release will have best effort support. Further details are available in
the selenium-webdriver package README.

### Change Summary

* Add support for Microsoft's Edge web browser
* Added `webdriver.Builder#buildAsync()`, which returns a promise that will be
    fulfilled with the newly created WebDriver instance once the associated
    browser has been full initialized. This is purely a convenient alternative
    to the existing build() method as the WebDriver class will always defer
    commands until it has a fully created browser.
* Added `firefox.Profile#setHost()` which may be used to set the host that
    the FirefoxDriver's server listens for commands on. The server uses
    "localhost" by default.
* Added `promise.Promise#catch()` for API compatibility with native Promises.
    `promise.Promise#thenCatch()` is not yet deprecated, but it simply
    delegates to `catch`.
* Changed some `io` operations to use native promises.
* Changed `command.Executor#execute()` and `HttpClient#send()` to return
    promises instead of using callback passing.
* Replaced the `Serializable` class with an internal, Symbol-defined method.
* Changed the `Capabilities` class to extend the native `Map` type.
* Changed the `Capabilities.has(key)` to only test if a capability has been set
    (Map semantics). To check whether the value is true, use `get(key)`.
* Deprecated `executors.DeferredExecutor` in favor of
    `lib/command.DeferredExecutor`.
* API documentation is no longer distributed with the npm package, but remains
    available at <http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/>
* Rewrote the `error` module to export an Error subtype for each type of error
    defined in the [W3C WebDriver spec](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#handling-errors).
* Changed the `http.Request` and `http.Response` classes to store headers in
    maps instead of object literals.
* Updated `ws` dependency to version `1.0.1`.
* Removed fluent predicates "is" and "not" from the experimental
    `testing/assert` module.
* Wait conditions that locate an element, or that wait on an element's state,
    will return a WebElementPromise.
* Lots of internal clean-up to break selenium-webdriver's long standing
    dependency on Google's Closure library.

### Changes for W3C WebDriver Spec Compliance

* Updated the `By` locators that are not in the W3C spec to delegated to using
    CSS selectors: `By.className`, `By.id`, `By.name`, and `By.tagName`.


## v2.49-51

* _Releases skipped to stay in sync with the rest of the Selenium project_


## v2.48.2

* Added `WebElement#takeScreenshot()`.
* More adjustments to promise callback tracking.

## v2.48.1

* FIXED: Adjusted how the control flow tracks promise callbacks to avoid a
    potential deadlock.

## v2.48.0

* Node v0.12.x users must run with --harmony. _This is the last release that
    will support v0.12.x_
* FIXED: (Promise/A+ compliance) When a promise is rejected with a thenable,
    the promise adopts the thenable as its rejection reason instead of waiting
    for it to settle. The previous (incorrect) behavior was hidden by bugs in
    the `promises-aplus-tests` compliance test suite that were fixed in version
    `2.1.1`.
* FIXED: the `webdriver.promise.ControlFlow` now has a consistent execution
    order for tasks/callbacks scheduled in different turns of the JS event loop.
    Refer to the `webdriver.promise` documentation for more details.
* FIXED: do not drop user auth from the WebDriver server URL.
* FIXED: a single `firefox.Binary` instance may be used to configure and
    launch multiple FirefoxDriver sessions.

      var binary = new firefox.Binary();
      var options = new firefox.Options().setBinary(binary);
      var builder = new Builder().setFirefoxOptions(options);

      var driver1 = builder.build();
      var driver2 = builder.build();

* FIXED: zip files created for transfer to a remote WebDriver server are no
    longer compressed. If the zip contained a file that was already compressed,
    the server would return an "invalid code lengths set" error.
* FIXED: Surfaced the `loopback` option to `remote/SeleniumServer`. When set,
    the server will be accessed using the current host's loopback address.

## v2.47.0

### Notice

This is the last release for `selenium-webdriver` that will support ES5.
Subsequent releases will depend on ES6 features that are enabled by
[default](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/) in Node v4.0.0. Node v0.12.x will
continue to be supported, but will require setting the `--harmony` flag.

### Change Summary

* Add support for [Node v4.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.0.0/)
    * Updated `ws` dependency from `0.7.1` to `0.8.0`
* Bumped the minimum supported version of Node from `0.10.x` to `0.12.x`. This
    is in accordance with the Node support policy established in `v2.45.0`.

## v2.46.1

* Fixed internal module loading on Windows.
* Fixed error message format on timeouts for `until.elementLocated()`
    and `until.elementsLocated()`.

## v2.46.0

* Exposed a new logging API via the `webdriver.logging` module. For usage, see
    `example/logging.js`.
* Added support for using a proxy server for WebDriver commands.
    See `Builder#usingWebDriverProxy()` for more info.
* Removed deprecated functions:
    * Capabilities#toJSON()
    * UnhandledAlertError#getAlert()
    * chrome.createDriver()
    * phantomjs.createDriver()
    * promise.ControlFlow#annotateError()
    * promise.ControlFlow#await()
    * promise.ControlFlow#clearHistory()
    * promise.ControlFlow#getHistory()
* Removed deprecated enum values: `ErrorCode.NO_MODAL_DIALOG_OPEN` and
    `ErrorCode.MODAL_DIALOG_OPENED`. Use `ErrorCode.NO_SUCH_ALERT` and
    `ErrorCode.UNEXPECTED_ALERT_OPEN`, respectively.
* FIXED: The `promise.ControlFlow` will maintain state for promise chains
    generated in a loop.
* FIXED: Correct serialize target elements used in an action sequence.
* FIXED: `promise.ControlFlow#wait()` now has consistent semantics for an
    omitted or 0-timeout: it will wait indefinitely.
* FIXED: `remote.DriverService#start()` will now fail if the child process dies
    while waiting for the server to start accepting requests. Previously, start
    would continue to poll the server address until the timeout expired.
* FIXED: Skip launching Firefox with the `-silent` flag to preheat the profile.
    Starting with Firefox 38, this would cause the browser to crash. This step,
    which was first introduced for Selenium's java client back with Firefox 2,
    no longer appears to be required.
* FIXED: 8564: `firefox.Driver#quit()` will wait for the Firefox process to
    terminate before deleting the temporary webdriver profile. This eliminates a
    race condition where Firefox would write profile data during shutdown,
    causing the `rm -rf` operation on the profile directory to fail.

## v2.45.1

* FIXED: 8548: Task callbacks are once again dropped if the task was cancelled
    due to a previously uncaught error within the frame.
* FIXED: 8496: Extended the `chrome.Options` API to cover all configuration
    options (e.g. mobile emulation and performance logging) documented on the
    ChromeDriver [project site](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/capabilities).

## v2.45.0

### Important Policy Change

Starting with the 2.45.0 release, selenium-webdriver will support the last
two stable minor releases for Node. For 2.45.0, this means Selenium will
support Node 0.10.x and 0.12.x. Support for the intermediate, un-stable release
(0.11.x) is "best-effort". This policy will be re-evaluated once Node has a
major version release (i.e. 1.0.0).

### Change Summary

* Added native browser support for Internet Explorer, Opera 26+, and Safari
* With the release of [Node 0.12.0](http://blog.nodejs.org/2015/02/06/node-v0-12-0-stable/)
    (finally!), the minimum supported version of Node is now `0.10.x`.
* The `promise` module is now [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/)
    compliant. The biggest compliance change is that promise callbacks are now
    invoked in a future turn of the JS event loop. For example:

        var promise = require('selenium-webdriver').promise;
        console.log('start');
        promise.fulfilled().then(function() {
          console.log('middle');
        });
        console.log('end');

        // Output in selenium-webdriver@2.44.0
        // start
        // middle
        // end
        //
        // Output in selenium-webdriver@2.45.0
        // start
        // end
        // middle

    The `promise.ControlFlow` class has been updated to track the asynchronous
    breaks required by Promises/A+, so there are no changes to task execution
    order.
* Updated how errors are annotated on failures. When a task fails, the
    stacktrace from when that task was scheduled is appended to the rejection
    reason with a `From: ` prefix (if it is an Error object). For example:

        var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
        driver.get('http://www.google.com/ncr');
        driver.call(function() {
          driver.wait(function() {
            return driver.isElementPresent(webdriver.By.id('not-there'));
          }, 2000, 'element not found');
        });

    This code will fail an error like:

        Error: element not found
        Wait timed out after 2002ms
            at <stack trace>
        From: Task: element not found
            at <stack trace>
        From: Task: WebDriver.call(function)
            at <stack trace>

* Changed the format of strings returned by `promise.ControlFlow#getSchedule`.
    This function now accepts a boolean to control whether the returned string
    should include the stacktraces for when each task was scheduled.
* Deprecating `promise.ControlFlow#getHistory`,
    `promise.ControlFlow#clearHistory`, and `promise.ControlFlow#annotateError`.
    These functions were all intended for internal use and are no longer
    necessary, so they have been made no-ops.
* `WebDriver.wait()` may now be used to wait for a promise to resolve, with
    an optional timeout. Refer to the API documentation for more information.
* Added support for copying files to a remote Selenium via `sendKeys` to test
    file uploads. Refer to the API documentation for more information. Sample
    usage included in `test/upload_test.js`
* Expanded the interactions API to include touch actions.
    See `WebDriver.touchActions()`.
* FIXED: 8380: `firefox.Driver` will delete its temporary profile on `quit`.
* FIXED: 8306: Stack overflow in promise callbacks eliminated.
* FIXED: 8221: Added support for defining custom command mappings. Includes
    support for PhantomJS's `executePhantomJS` (requires PhantomJS 1.9.7 or
    GhostDriver 1.1.0).
* FIXED: 8128: When the FirefoxDriver marshals an object to the page for
    `executeScript`, it defines additional properties (required by the driver's
    implementation). These properties will no longer be enumerable and should
    be omitted (i.e. they won't show up in JSON.stringify output).
* FIXED: 8094: The control flow will no longer deadlock when a task returns
    a promise that depends on the completion of sub-tasks.

## v2.44.0

* Added the `until` module, which defines common explicit wait conditions.
    Sample usage:

        var firefox = require('selenium-webdriver/firefox'),
            until = require('selenium-webdriver/until');

        var driver = new firefox.Driver();
        driver.get('http://www.google.com/ncr');
        driver.wait(until.titleIs('Google Search'), 1000);

* FIXED: 8000: `Builder.forBrowser()` now accepts an empty string since some
    WebDriver implementations ignore the value. A value must still be specified,
    however, since it is a required field in WebDriver's wire protocol.
* FIXED: 7994: The `stacktrace` module will not modify stack traces if the
    initial parse fails (e.g. the user defined `Error.prepareStackTrace`)
* FIXED: 5855: Added a module (`until`) that defines several common conditions
    for use with explicit waits. See updated examples for usage.

## v2.43.5

* FIXED: 7905: `Builder.usingServer(url)` once again returns `this` for
    chaining.

## v2.43.2-4

* No changes; version bumps while attempting to work around an issue with
    publishing to npm (a version string may only be used once).

## v2.43.1

* Fixed an issue with flakiness when setting up the Firefox profile that could
    prevent the driver from initializing properly.

## v2.43.0

* Added native support for Firefox - the Java Selenium server is no longer
    required.
* Added support for generator functions to `ControlFlow#execute` and
    `ControlFlow#wait`. For more information, see documentation on
    `webdriver.promise.consume`. Requires harmony support (run with
    `node --harmony-generators` in `v0.11.x`).
* Various improvements to the `Builder` API. Notably, the `build()` function
    will no longer default to attempting to use a server at
    `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub` if it cannot start a browser directly -
    you must specify the WebDriver server with `usingServer(url)`. You can
    also set the target browser and WebDriver server through a pair of
    environment variables. See the documentation on the `Builder` constructor
    for more information.
* For consistency with the other language bindings, added browser specific
    classes that can be used to start a browser without the builder.

        var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver')
            chrome = require('selenium-webdriver/chrome');

        // The following are equivalent.
        var driver1 = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
        var driver2 = new chrome.Driver();

* Promise A+ compliance: a promise may no longer resolve to itself.
* For consistency with other language bindings, deprecated
    `UnhandledAlertError#getAlert` and added `#getAlertText`.
    `getAlert` will be removed in `2.45.0`.
* FIXED: 7641: Deprecated `ErrorCode.NO_MODAL_DIALOG_OPEN` and
    `ErrorCode.MODAL_DIALOG_OPENED` in favor of the new
    `ErrorCode.NO_SUCH_ALERT` and `ErrorCode.UNEXPECTED_ALERT_OPEN`,
    respectively.
* FIXED: 7563: Mocha integration no longer disables timeouts. Default Mocha
    timeouts apply (2000 ms) and may be changed using `this.timeout(ms)`.
* FIXED: 7470: Make it easier to create WebDriver instances in custom flows for
    parallel execution.

## v2.42.1

* FIXED: 7465: Fixed `net.getLoopbackAddress` on Windows
* FIXED: 7277: Support `done` callback in Mocha's BDD interface
* FIXED: 7156: `Promise#thenFinally` should not suppress original error

## v2.42.0

* Removed deprecated functions `Promise#addCallback()`,
    `Promise#addCallbacks()`, `Promise#addErrback()`, and `Promise#addBoth()`.
* Fail with a more descriptive error if the server returns a malformed redirect
* FIXED: 7300: Connect to ChromeDriver using the loopback address since
    ChromeDriver 2.10.267517 binds to localhost by default.
* FIXED: 7339: Preserve wrapped test function's string representation for
    Mocha's BDD interface.

## v2.41.0

* FIXED: 7138: export logging API from webdriver module.
* FIXED: 7105: beforeEach/it/afterEach properly bind `this` for Mocha tests.

## v2.40.0

* API documentation is now included in the docs directory.
* Added utility functions for working with an array of promises:
    `promise.all`, `promise.map`, and `promise.filter`
* Introduced `Promise#thenCatch()` and `Promise#thenFinally()`.
* Deprecated `Promise#addCallback()`, `Promise#addCallbacks()`,
    `Promise#addErrback()`, and `Promise#addBoth()`.
* Removed deprecated function `webdriver.WebDriver#getCapability`.
* FIXED: 6826: Added support for custom locators.

## v2.39.0

* Version bump to stay in sync with the Selenium project.

## v2.38.1

* FIXED: 6686: Changed `webdriver.promise.Deferred#cancel()` to silently no-op
    if the deferred has already been resolved.

## v2.38.0

* When a promise is rejected, always annotate the stacktrace with the parent
    flow state so users can identify the source of an error.
* Updated tests to reflect features not working correctly in the SafariDriver
    (cookie management and proxy support; see issues 5051, 5212, and 5503)
* FIXED: 6284: For mouse moves, correctly omit the x/y offsets if not
    specified as a function argument (instead of passing (0,0)).
* FIXED: 6471: Updated documentation on `webdriver.WebElement#getAttribute`
* FIXED: 6612: On Unix, use the default IANA ephemeral port range if unable to
    retrieve the current system's port range.
* FIXED: 6617: Avoid triggering the node debugger when initializing the
    stacktrace module.
* FIXED: 6627: Safely rebuild chrome.Options from a partial JSON spec.

## v2.37.0

* FIXED: 6346: The remote.SeleniumServer class now accepts JVM arguments using
    the `jvmArgs` option.

## v2.36.0

* _Release skipped to stay in sync with main Selenium project._

## v2.35.2

* FIXED: 6200: Pass arguments to the Selenium server instead of to the JVM.

## v2.35.1

* FIXED: 6090: Changed example scripts to use chromedriver.

## v2.35.0

* Version bump to stay in sync with the Selenium project.

## v2.34.1

* FIXED: 6079: The parent process should not wait for spawn driver service
    processes (chromedriver, phantomjs, etc.)

## v2.34.0

* Added the `selenium-webdriver/testing/assert` module. This module
    simplifies writing assertions against promised values (see
    example in module documentation).
* Added the `webdriver.Capabilities` class.
* Added native support for the ChromeDriver. When using the `Builder`,
    requesting chrome without specifying a remote server URL will default to
    the native ChromeDriver implementation.  The
    [ChromeDriver server](https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list)
    must be downloaded separately.

        // Will start ChromeDriver locally.
        var driver = new webdriver.Builder().
            withCapabilities(webdriver.Capabilities.chrome()).
            build();

        // Will start ChromeDriver using the remote server.
        var driver = new webdriver.Builder().
            withCapabilities(webdriver.Capabilities.chrome()).
            usingServer('http://server:1234/wd/hub').
            build();

* Added support for configuring proxies through the builder. For examples, see
    `selenium-webdriver/test/proxy_test`.
* Added native support for PhantomJS.
* Changed signature of `SeleniumServer` to `SeleniumServer(jar, options)`.
* Tests are now included in the npm published package. See `README.md` for
    execution instructions
* Removed the deprecated `webdriver.Deferred#resolve` and
    `webdriver.promise.resolved` functions.
* Removed the ability to connect to an existing session from the Builder. This
    feature is intended for use with the browser-based client.

## v2.33.0

* Added support for WebDriver's logging API
* FIXED: 5511: Added webdriver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms)

## v2.32.1

* FIXED: 5541: Added missing return statement for windows in
    `portprober.findFreePort()`

## v2.32.0

* Added the `selenium-webdriver/testing` package, which provides a basic
    framework for writing tests using Mocha. See
    `selenium-webdriver/example/google_search_test.js` for usage.
* For Promises/A+ compatibility, backing out the change in 2.30.0 that ensured
    rejections were always Error objects. Rejection reasons are now left as is.
* Removed deprecated functions originally scheduled for removal in 2.31.0
    * promise.Application.getInstance()
    * promise.ControlFlow#schedule()
    * promise.ControlFlow#scheduleTimeout()
    * promise.ControlFlow#scheduleWait()
* Renamed some functions for consistency with Promises/A+ terminology. The
    original functions have been deprecated and will be removed in 2.34.0:
    * promise.resolved() -> promise.fulfilled()
    * promise.Deferred#resolve() -> promise.Deferred#fulfill()
* FIXED: remote.SeleniumServer#stop now shuts down within the active control
    flow, allowing scripts to finish. Use #kill to shutdown immediately.
* FIXED: 5321: cookie deletion commands

## v2.31.0

* Added an example script.
* Added a class for controlling the standalone Selenium server (server
available separately)
* Added a portprober for finding free ports
* FIXED: WebElements now belong to the same flow as their parent driver.

## v2.30.0

* Ensures promise rejections are always Error values.
* Version bump to keep in sync with the Selenium project.

## v2.29.1

* Fixed a bug that could lead to an infinite loop.
* Added a README.md

## v2.29.0

* Initial release for npm:

        npm install selenium-webdriver
