=======
  (summary not created, check version history logs)

v2.30.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Fixing a bug introduced by a change in how we get already logged
    messages from the console service in firefox. This allows us to
    function with firefox 19
  * FIXED: 1181: Improved loopback detection
  * FIXED: 1627: Implementing ability to use auto proxy in
    HtmlUnitDriver.

    visible.
  * Semi-private change: Changes in the Coordinate class.

JS:
  * Update WebDriverJS to support parallel flows.  This change renames
   several low-level classes and functions in the promise module:
    
      promise.Application                                 -> promise.ControlFlow
        #schedule(string, function)                       ->   #execute(function, [string])
        #scheduleTimeout(string, number)                  ->   #timeout(number, [string])
        #scheduleWait(string, function, number, [string]) ->   #wait(function, number, [string])

=======

WebDriver:
  * Firefox 18 support.
  * IEDriver supports "requireWindowFocus" desired capability. When
    using this and native events, the IE driver will demand focus and
    user interactions will use SendInput() for simulating user
    interactions. Note that this will mean you MUST NOT use the
    machine running IE for anything else as the tests are running.
  * Use the "webdriver.remote.shorten_log_messages" system property to
    reduce the verboseness of ouput from executeScript and
    executeAsyncScript when using the RemoteWebDriver.
  * Switching HtmlUnitDriver default from FIREFOX_3_6 to FIREFOX_10
  * SafariDriverExtension should restore Safari's previous settings on
    shutdown.
  * Bundled version of PhantomJSDriver bumped to 1.0.1
  * Updated the version of guava-libraries used to 14.
  * Updated HtmlUnit to 2.11
  * Deprecated XPathLookupException in favour of
    InvalidSelectorException
  * FIXED: 3602: Changing IE view port calculations to allow for
    always-present vertical scroll bar, and to test for horizontal
    scroll bar and adjust as required by page content.
  * FIXED: 4576: self registering proxy now check for user specified
    proxy id.
  * FIXED: 5010: icons in chrome newtab now correctly identified as
    being shown.

RC:
  * FIXED: 4818: Make sure that each generated SSL cert has a unique
    ID associated with it.

Project:
  * Moved to git. Most obvious in revision number in our exceptions.


v2.28.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * "null" can now be passed to executeScript
  * .Net: Corrected FileUtilities.FindFile() to correctly return the
    current directory if the specified file is located there.
  * .Net: Introduces the Updating the CustomFinderType property to the
    .NET FindsByAttribute. This allows use of custom By subclasses in
    the PageFactory. The custom finder must be a subclass of By, and
    it must expose a public constructor that takes a string argument.
  * SafariDriver: better attempts to catch native dialogs from user
    defined onbeforeunload handlers.
  * Updating HtmlUnit to 2.11
  * Added the PhantomJS bindings to the release. You'll still need to
    download PhantomJS itself separately.

RC:
  * Implemented getAllWindowNames in WebDriverBackedSelenium
  * Implemented openWindow in WebDriverBackedSelenium to allow opening
    relative URLs


v2.27.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Added support for native events for Firefox 17. 
  * Added support for ghostdriver (PhantomJS)
  * Adding new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup" to the IE
    driver. When set to true, the IE driver will clean the
    known-element cache of invalid elements after every page
    load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve
    performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this
    capability is provided temporarily to allow disabling this
    behavior if problems arise. The default of this new capability is
    "true", meaning this behavior is turned on by default.
  * Added shift key handling to the synthetic keyboard actions.
  * Modifying scroll behavior in IE driver SendKeysCommandHandler to
    call Element::GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView() instead of calling
    the DOM scrollIntoView() function. Should result in less page
    scrolling during test runs.
  * Checking if CSS transforms on elements, or their parents, are
    hiding them and therefore returning they arent visible.
  * Add not, refreshed, invisibilityOfElementWithText to
    ExpectedConditions.
  * Added support for new IE10 pointer events.
  * FIXED: 1543: Allowing equal sign in a cookie value.
  * FIXED: 2103, 3508: Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered
    by onchange of <select> elements or by onsubmit of <form>
    elements.
  * FIXED: 2035: Returning a simple result (null) after opening a new
    window instead of the window object (that can't be serialized to
    JSON).
  * FIXED: 2353: Only call blur() for IE if the element is not the
    <body> element.
  * FIXED: 3043: Better error message reporting when browser launch
    fails.
  * FIXED: 4490: Checking script evaluation result to prevent null
    reference exception.
  * FIXED: 4736: Added all of the extended colour keywords to the
    Colors enum in support of
    http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Color/Extended_color_keywords.
  * FIXED: 4800: Fixed calculation of coordinates for elements in
    frames/iframes where the element is scrolled out of view within
    the frame.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 3818: Generating session identifiers with UUID to prevent duplication.

RC:
  * FIXED: 4668: Fixing ability to open relative URLs in WDBS.
  * FIXED: 4273: Added getCssCount to the list of the methods
    supported by WebDriverBackedSelenium.
  * FIXED: 4055: WDBS implementation of getValue for radio buttons now
    reflects behaviour of RC.
  * FIXED: 4784: Processing locators before use in getCssCount and
    getXpathCount.


v2.26.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated OperaDriver to 0.15.
  * Added transparency support to the Color class.
  * Increased lock time a bit for the FirefoxDriver to make tests more 
    stable on Windows.

    whether to use the persistent hover thread in the IE driver. Defaults
	to true for IE.
  * Added support for native events for Firefox 15 and 16.
  * Removed deprecation from ChromeDriver constructors that take a Capabilities
    object. Also added a method to set experimental options in ChromeOptions
	which may be used to set options that aren't exposed through the ChromeOptions
    API.
  * Fixed SafariDriver to allow calling .quit() consecutively without error.
  * Modified FirefoxDriver to use atoms to switch between frames.
  * FIXED: 4535: Hover still does not work perfectly in IE.
  * FIXED: 4676: Unable to fire javascript events into SVG's. 
  * FIXED: 4320: Impossible to IE run tests in parallel via TestNG.

  * FIXED: 4526: elenium node stop responding when there are 2 or more tests
    waiting for a specific node.
  * FIXED: 2549: "-role hub" doesn't allow Firefox to starts.

v2.25.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Added API for dealing with BASIC and DIGEST authentication
    dialogs. Currently not implemented in any drivers.
  * Warn users that the IE driver will no longer use the DLL in the
    next release.
  * Deprecated browser specific WebElement subclasses.
  * Added support for "requiredCapabilities" to the remote webdrivers
    and implemented basic support for these in the firefox
    driver. Failure to fulfull a required capability will cause a
    SessionNotCreatedException to be thrown.
  * Added the ability to determine how unhandled alerts should be
    handled. This is handled by the "unexpectedAlertBehaviour"
    capability, which can be one of "accept", "dismiss" or
    "ignore". Java code should use the UnexpectedAlertBehaviour
    enum. This is only implemented in Firefox for now.
  * Allow native events to be configured in Firefox and
    (experimentally) in IE using the "nativeEvents" capability.
  * Updated supported versions of Firefox to 17.
  * Firefox driver will enumerate through client rects until finding
    one with non-zero dimensions when clicking.

    visibility.
  * Point users in the right direction when Safari fails to load a
    file:// URL.
  * Allowed to use IEDriverServer logging abilities in Java binding.
  * Avoid an issue where a call to submit could hang the firefox
    driver.
  * FluentWait will now handle any Throwable, not just
    RuntimeExceptions.
  * FIXED: 3897: Allow windows to be resized from a frame.

WebDriverJS:
  * Better stack traces from test code.
  * Update webdriver.atoms.element.type to recognize
    webdriver.Key.SEPARATOR

RC:
  * Better emulation provided by the WebDriver-backed Selenium when
    using IE, particularly when emulating firing of events.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 3230: Implementing /lifecycle-manager?action=shutdown
    command for the Grid Hub to ensure backward compatibility with
    Grid1 behaviour.

  * SafariDriver is (still) in Beta, annotated accordingly in Java
  * FIXED: 3785: Implicit waits for Safari driver
  * FIXED: 1225: Get text is handled appropriately for self-closing tags.

v2.22.0
=======

Project:
  * Code grant from Google acknowledged in our copyright
    headers. Thanks, Google!

WebDriver:
  * JRE dependency upped to Java 6.
  * IE driver now uses the IEDriverServer. You may need to download
    this. Set the "useLegacyInternalServer" to boolean true if you
    need the old behaviour.
  * Standardized colour values returned from getCssValue are
    normalized to RGBA.
  * IE can use synthesized events if the capability
    "enableNativeEvents" is set to false. This is experimental and not
    expected to work properly.
  * Native events added for Firefox 12. 
  * Native events retained for Firefox 10, 11, and 3.x
  * Selenium-backed WebDriver can now return WebElements from

    differentiate between browser hang and client gone (which is
    -timeout <timeout>)
    - System property -Dselenium.server.timeout removed, use -timeout instead.
    See http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer 
    for further details.
    * Issue 3577

  * Updated operadriver to version 0.9

Maven:

  * NOTE: We have removed our dependency on the operadriver from our
    pom, because it creates a circular dependency.  To use the
    operadriver, add the following dependency to your own pom.xml
    file:

    to the latest and greatest.

WebDriverJS:
  * Test failures are now annotated with the task history.
  * JSONP support dropped in favour of CORS. For those browsers where
    CORS is not fully implemented, added a "/xdrpc" (cross-domain rpc)
    end-point.
  * Change the promise.Application event loop to run at a set interval
    instead of trying to explicitly trigger it at the appropriate
    times. This makes debugging much simpler.
  * WebDriverJS hub front-end now renders correctly in IE.

Grid:
  * It's now a beautiful butterfly.

RC:
  * IE HTA mode will now close the final window.
  * All windows are now opened as "resizable". This means that they
    should always open in new windows rather than tabs in IE.
  * *chrome mode can type into file input elements on Firefox 8+
