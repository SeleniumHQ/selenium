v2.21.0 (In Progress)
=======

WebDriver:
  * Significant stability improvements in firefoxdriver.

Grid:
  * Significant changes in the timeout strategy between hub, nodes and browser.
    See http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2 section on timeouts.
    Compatibility note: It is recommended to at least update the nodes
    to 2.21. Upgrading only the hub will effectively disable the 
    browser-death timeout.

  * Content length issue solved
  * Improvements in thread dumps in both hub and node,
    possible to corrolate the two.

Server:
  * -Dwebdriver.server.browser.timeout=<timeoutInSeconds> added to
    differentiate between browser hang and client gone (which is
    webdriver.server.session.timeout as before)
    See http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer 
    for further details.


v2.20.0 
=======

WebDriver:
  * RemoteWebDriver.setLogLevel is no longer a static method.
  * Introduce a timeout for page loads. This needs to be used in
    conjunction with the unstable page load detection.
  * Adding alertIsPresent ExpectedCondition.
  * Turning off password saving in the Android driver.
  * FIXED: 3391: scroll containing elements, not just windows.
  * FIXED: 2211: Allow the http client factory to discover the proxy
    for traffic between the http command executor and the webdriver
    server via the normal system properties.

WebDriverJS:
  * Refactored the WebDriverJs promise manager to use a proper tree to
    track scheduled tasks.
  * In webdriver.Builder, default to http://localhost:4444/wd/hub if a
    server URL is not specified.

Grid:
  * JDK 1.6.1_31 recommended for maximum stability
  * The HUB is now upgraded to run with Jetty 7.6.1.
  * Making the id for proxy final, and allowing it to be specified
    from the registration request. If the id isn't in the request, the
    remote host is used as an id, as it was before.
  * FIXED: 3096: Memory leak in selenium hub.

RC:
  * More work on SSL certs. Should work cleanly in Firefox now.
  * FIXED: 1982: Clear an input element in such a way as to avoid
    firing any events when emulating typing in selenium
    emulation. Fixes issue 1982.

Atoms:
  * Submit a form when the enter button is pressed in its input
    element.
  * Add a "mouse pixel scroll" event to the atoms events module.
  * Adding a public "mouseOver" action and a little internal
    refactoring around the mouseOver functionality.


v2.19.0
=======

WebDriver: 
  * Server-side implementation of the webdriver-backed selenium.
  * "sendKeys" works in the webdriver-backed selenium when using
    safari.
  * Implement local/session storage for iOS driver.
  * Exceptions now thrown when an alert occurs during script
    execution.
  * Native events implemented for Firefox 10.
  * Renamed the experimental "fast" page loaded strategy "unstable"
    and disable queuing of commands when it's enabled.
  * Corrections to javadocs.
  * Disabled native events for Firefox 8 as it's deprecated by
    Mozilla.

RC:
  * Update cybervillains certificate (thanks to Ivan De Marino and
    Mark Watson @ Neustar)
  * Default to using the native xpath engine in selenium-backed
    webdriver instances.
  * Correctly fire events when outside a firefox extension

WebDriverJS:
  * Return a promise from webdriver.WebDriver.prototype.quit() so
    users may register callbacks.
  * Small tweaks so WebDriverJs works as expected in IE7/8.

Known Issues:
  * Holding down a modifier key and clicking with Firefox 10 on
    Windows does not work reliably when using native events.


v2.18.0
========

WebDriver:
  * FIXED: 3169: Getting value attribute on option elements.
  * Alert handling in Firefox and IE: Throwing UnhandledAlertException
    if an alert is present during an operation. The unhandled alert is
    also dismissed to mitigate repeat exceptions.
  * Better handling of getText invocations on SVG elements.
  * FIXED: 3253: Clicking stopped working on Firefox 4.
  * Android Driver now supports Flash, Geolocation.
  * FIXED: 1371: iPhone Driver now supports frame switching.

  * FIXED: 3169: getAttribute("value") falls back to the text of
    option tags, if no value attribute is specified
  * Updated operadriver to version 0.9

Maven:

  * NOTE: We have removed our dependency on the operadriver from our
    pom, because it creates a circular dependency.  To use the
    operadriver, add the following dependency to your own pom.xml
    file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.opera</groupId>
      <artifactId>operadriver</artifactId>
      <version>0.9</version>
    </dependency>

  * The FirefoxDriver now enables apps to use offline storage by
    default.
  * ChromeDriver allows setting the chrome driver's environment more
    easily.
  * RemoteWebElement implementations now guarantee that the ID used to
    identify them. This allows "hashCode" and "equals" to be local
    operations in Java.

    to the latest and greatest.

WebDriverJS:

    CORS is not fully implemented, added a "/xdrpc" (cross-domain rpc)
    end-point.
  * Change the promise.Application event loop to run at a set interval
    instead of trying to explicitly trigger it at the appropriate
    times. This makes debugging much simpler.
  * WebDriverJS hub front-end now renders correctly in IE.

Grid:
  * It's now a beautiful butterfly.

RC:
  * IE HTA mode will now close the final window.
  * All windows are now opened as "resizable". This means that they
    should always open in new windows rather than tabs in IE.
  * *chrome mode can type into file input elements on Firefox 8+
  * WebDriverCommandProcessor has all constructors depending on the
    (deprecated) SuppliesWebDriver class marked as deprecated. Will be

    webdriver tests.
  * Added an UnreachableBrowserException.

    thrown.


v2.13.0
=======
Dependency change:
  * Selenium/webdriver java dependencies now use apache commons-exec
    (http://commons.apache.org/exec/) version 1.1. If you are using manual
    dependency management you will need to add this to your project.
    If you resolve via maven central (maven, ivy, gradle), this will
    be handled automatically.
