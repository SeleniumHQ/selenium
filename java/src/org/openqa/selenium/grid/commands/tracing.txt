Selenium Grid ships with support for distributed tracing, backed by
the OpenTelemetry APIs. This allows admins and devops engineers to
trace the flow of control through the Grid for each and every command.

To enable this support, you must first provide a "Tracer"
implementation that should be used. We use OpenTelemtry's own
mechanisms for selecting the implementations, so if your chosen
tracing library supports this you should be good to go. If you are
using the standalone selenium jar, updating the classpath to contain
your tracer can be done using the `--ext` flag to selenium.

As a worked example, using Jaeger as the tracing library and running
on macOS:

```
  java -Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger \
       -Dotel.exporter.jaeger.endpoint=http://localhost:14250 \
       -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=selenium-standalone \
       -jar selenium.jar \
       --ext $(coursier fetch -p \
          io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger:1.15.0 \
          io.grpc:grpc-netty:1.45.0) \
       standalone
```

This example uses a tool called "coursier" to generate a full
classpath, but you can also write this manually. When started this
way, the selenium server will inform you that it has found a tracer on
stdout.

You will also need to be running a tracing server somewhere. In the
case of Jaeger, you can do this using docker to fire up something
locally:

```
  docker run --rm -it --name jaeger \
    -p 16686:16686 \
    -p 14250:14250 \
    jaegertracing/all-in-one:1
```

Now run some tests, and then point a browser at
http://localhost:16686/ to view the outputs.

There are other popular tracing libraries that are supported by
OpenTelemetry, so please check their documentation for more
information on how to configure them.
