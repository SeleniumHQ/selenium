  * Fixed an issue when passing instance of Profile to an Options in capabilities
    (thanks @masakazutakewaka).

DevTools:
  * Added support for multiple version of CDP. Currently supported versions are
    84-87. The proper version is automatically selected when the browser is started
    based on its version. The implementation is Chromium-based and is confirmed
    to work in Chrome and Edge at least.

  * Added support for listening to JavaScript exceptions (see HasLogEvents).

4.0.0.alpha6 (2020-05-28)
=========================

Chrome:
  * Added DevTools classes and methods generated from the CDP specification.
    It currently supports commands and events and provides Rubyish API:
      driver.devtools.page.navigate(url: 'http://google.com')
      driver.devtools.console.clear_messages
      driver.devtools.page.enable
      driver.devtools.page.on(:load_event_fired) do |params|
        puts("Page loaded in #{params['timestamp']}")
      end
    Check https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/ for more information
    about possible commands and events. Please note that this API is considered
    to be experimental and may change any time before stable 4.0 release.
  * Fixed an issue when passing :prompt_for_download (or similar snake_cased
    symbols) in Options#prefs would be ignored by Chrome because Selenium
    would internally convert it to camelCased format (:promptForDownload).
    Now :prefs are left intact.

Edge:
  * Fixed an issue when Driver#execute_cdp would not work for Chromium-based
    Edge browser.

Ruby:
  * Deprecated passing :desired_capabilities and :options to driver initialization
    in favor of :capabilities. They now can be combined in an array to make
    custom capabilities requirements:
      caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.chrome
      opts = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options.new
      Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, capabilities: :chrome)
      Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, capabilities: caps)
      Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, capabilities: opts)
      Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, capabilities: [caps, opts])
  * Deprecated passing Hash to :capabilities in favor of Remote::Capabilities object.
  * Updated minimum require Ruby version to 2.5.
  * Improved keyword arguments handling to avoid warnings in Ruby 2.7.

4.0.0.alpha5 (2020-03-18)
=========================

The release is just to synchronize version with other bindings and does not
include any changes.

4.0.0.alpha4 (2020-01-09)
=========================

Ruby:
  * Added initial support for relative locators, which allow to find elements
    above/below/left/right/near another element. For example, you can find all
    the cells in a table to the right of your starting cell:
      start_cell = driver.find_element(css: 'td')
      right_cells = driver.find_elements(relative: {tag_name: 'td', right: start_cell})
    The documentation is still lacking so refer to examples in df6be2e962.
  * Added ability to silence certain logger messages by using it's identifiers:
      Selenium::WebDriver.logger.ignore(:driver_path)
  * Added new dependency: websocket. It's used for communicating with Chrome DevTools.
  * Loosened childprocess dependency to allow using version 2.0+.
  * Loosened rubyzip dependency to allow using version 2.0+.
  * Fixed Errno::EACCES error on Linux DeX and similar distributes

Chrome:
  * Added initial support for communicating with Chrome DevTools. The implementation
    is very basic and lacks CDP domains, events and types - those will be added
    in future releases. Still, it allows to execute simple commands to DevTools:
      driver.devtools.send('Page.navigate', {url: 'https://google.com'})

    object can be passed as :service keyword during driver initialization.
  * Deprecated Chrome.driver_path= in favor of Service::Chrome.driver_path=

Edge:
  * Added support for instantiating service class directly and moved all driver
    executable configuration there (command-line arguments, port, etc.)

    :options key. This feature allows to use browser-specific options classes
    (Chrome::Options, Firefox::Options, etc.) and pass them to Server/Grid
    instead of capabilities.
