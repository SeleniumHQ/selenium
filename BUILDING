Selenium 2.0 builds with its own build technology that's good for Windows, Linux and Mac.

Quick intro
===========

In the same directory as this file, do ...

   ./go

The order of building modules is determined by the 'go' system itself.  If you want to 
build an individual module (assuming all dependent modules have previously been build)
try something like ...

   ./go //jsapi:atoms:run

In this case, jsapi is the module directory, and "atoms" is a target in that directory's 
build.desc file

Maven POM files
===============

Ignore the Maven POM file present in the same directory. It is only used for releasing 
to jars to Maven Repository (public or local), and is not considered the main build
mechanism.

Build Output
============

"./go" only makes a top-level "build" directory. Outputs are placed under that relative 
to the target name. Which is probably best described with an example. For the target:

  //common/src/js/webdriver:webdriver

The output is found under:

  build/common/src/js/webdriver/webdriver.js

If you watch the build, each step should print where its output is going. Java test 
outputs appear in one of two places: either under build/test_logs for junit or in 
build/build_log.xml for TestNG tests. If you'd like the build to be chattier, just 
append "log=true" to the build command line.

Help with 'Go'
==============

More general help for 'go' ...

   ./go --help
