Please [post questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask). You can open issues with questions, as long you add a link to your Stack Overflow question.\n 2. For bug reports and feature requests, open issues. :bug:\n 3. For direct and quick help, you can [use Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/johnnyb). :rocket:\n\n\n## :memo: Documentation\n\n\n### `merge(dst, src)`\nOne level merge. Faster than `deepMerge`.\n\n#### Params\n\n- **** `dst`: {Object} The destination object.\n- **** `src`: {Object} The source object (usually defaults).\n\n#### Return\n- **Object** The result object.\n\n### `deepMerge()`\nRecursively merge the objects from arguments, returning a new object.\n\nUsage: `Ul.deepMerge(obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4, ..., objN)`\n\n#### Return\n- **Object** The merged objects.\n\n### `clone(item)`\nDeep clone of the provided item.\n\n#### Params\n\n- **Anything** `item`: The item that should be cloned\n\n#### Return\n- **Anything** The cloned object\n\n### `home()`\nGet the home directory path on any platform. The value can be\naccessed using `Ul.HOME_DIR` too.\n\n#### Return\n- **String** The home directory path.\n\n\n\n## :yum: How to contribute\nHave an idea? Found a bug? See [how to contribute][contributing].\n\n\n## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects\n\nI open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,\nthis takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).\n\nHowever, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:\n\n - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:\n - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books!
