  "readme": "## Any Promise\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kevinbeaty/any-promise.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/kevinbeaty/any-promise)\n\nLet your library support any ES 2015 (ES6) compatible `Promise` and leave the choice to application authors. The application can *optionally* register its preferred `Promise` implementation and it will be exported when requiring `any-promise` from library code.\n\nIf no preference is registered, defaults to the global `Promise` for newer Node.js versions. The browser version defaults to the window `Promise`, so polyfill or register as necessary.\n\n### Usage with global Promise:\n\nAssuming the global `Promise` is the desired implementation:\n\n```bash\n# Install any libraries depending on any-promise\n$ npm install mz\n```\n\nThe installed libraries will use global Promise by default.\n\n```js\n// in library\nvar Promise = require('any-promise')  // the global Promise\n\nfunction promiseReturningFunction(){\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){...})\n}\n```\n\n### Usage with registration:\n\nAssuming `bluebird` is the desired Promise implementation:\n\n```bash\n# Install preferred promise library\n$ npm install bluebird\n# Install any-promise to allow registration\n$ npm install any-promise\n# Install any libraries you would like to use depending on any-promise\n$ npm install mz\n```\n\nRegister your preference in the application entry point before any other `require` of packages that load `any-promise`:\n\n```javascript\n// top of application index.js or other entry point\nrequire('any-promise/register/bluebird')\n\n// -or- Equivalent to above, but allows customization of Promise library\nrequire('any-promise/register')('bluebird', {Promise: require('bluebird')})\n```\n\nNow that the implementation is registered, you can use any package depending on `any-promise`:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar fsp = require('mz/fs') // mz/fs will use registered bluebird promises\nvar Promise = require('any-promise')  // the registered bluebird promise \n```\n\nIt is safe to call `register` multiple times, but it must always be with the same implementation.\n\nAgain, registration is *optional*. It should only be called by the application user if overriding the global `Promise` implementation is desired.\n\n### Optional Application Registration\n\nAs an application author, you can *optionally* register a preferred `Promise` implementation on application startup (before any call to `require('any-promise')`:\n\nYou must register your preference before any call to `require('any-promise')` (by you or required packages), and only one implementation can be registered. Typically, this registration would occur at the top of the application entry point.\n\n\n#### Registration shortcuts\n\nIf you are using a known `Promise` implementation, you can register your preference with a shortcut:\n\n\n```js\nrequire('any-promise/register/bluebird')\n// -or-\nimport 'any-promise/register/q';\n```\n\nShortcut registration is the preferred registration method as it works in the browser and Node.js. It is also convenient for using with `import` and many test runners, that offer a `--require` flag:\n\n```\n$ ava --require=any-promise/register/bluebird test.js\n```\n\nCurrent known implementations include `bluebird`, `q`, `when`, `rsvp`, `es6-promise`, `promise`, `native-promise-only`, `pinkie`, `vow` and `lie`. If you are not using a known implementation, you can use another registration method described below.\n\n\n#### Basic Registration\n\nAs an alternative to registration shortcuts, you can call the `register` function with the preferred `Promise` implementation. The benefit of this approach is that a `Promise` library can be required by name without being a known implementation.  This approach does NOT work in the browser. To use `any-promise` in the browser use either registration shortcuts or specify the `Promise` constructor using advanced registration (see below).\n\n```javascript\nrequire('any-promise/register')('when')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('any other ES6 compatible library (known or otherwise)')\n```\n\nThis registration method will try to detect the `Promise` constructor from requiring the specified implementation.  If you would like to specify your own constructor, see advanced registration.\n\n\n#### Advanced Registration\n\nTo use the browser version, you should either install a polyfill or explicitly register the `Promise` constructor:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('any-promise/register')('bluebird', {Promise: require('bluebird')})\n```\n\nThis could also be used for registering a custom `Promise` implementation or subclass.\n\nYour preference will be registered globally, allowing a single registration even if multiple versions of `any-promise` are installed in the NPM dependency tree or are using multiple bundled JavaScript files in the browser. You can bypass this global registration in options:\n\n\n```javascript\nrequire('../register')('es6-promise', {Promise: require('es6-promise').Promise, global: false})\n```\n\n### Library Usage\n\nTo use any `Promise` constructor, simply require it:\n\n```javascript\nvar Promise = require('any-promise');\n\nreturn Promise\n  .all([xf, f, init, coll])\n  .then(fn);\n\n\nreturn new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n  try {\n    resolve(item);\n  } catch(e){\n    reject(e);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\nExcept noted below, libraries using `any-promise` should only use [documented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) functions as there is no guarantee which implementation will be chosen by the application author.  Libraries should never call `register`, only the application user should call if desired.\n\n\n#### Advanced Library Usage\n\nIf your library needs to branch code based on the registered implementation, you can retrieve it using `var impl = require('any-promise/implementation')`, where `impl` will be the package name (`\"bluebird\"`, `\"when\"`, etc.) if registered, `\"global.Promise\"` if using the global version on Node.js, or `\"window.Promise\"` if using the browser version. You should always include a default case, as there is no guarantee what package may be registered.\n\n\n### Support for old Node.js versions\n\nNode.js versions prior to `v0.12` may have contained buggy versions of the global `Promise`. For this reason, the global `Promise` is not loaded automatically for these old versions.  If using `any-promise` in Node.js versions versions `<= v0.12`, the user should register a desired implementation.\n\nIf an implementation is not registered, `any-promise` will attempt to discover an installed `Promise` implementation.  If no implementation can be found, an error will be thrown on `require('any-promise')`.  While the auto-discovery usually avoids errors, it is non-deterministic. It is recommended that the user always register a preferred implementation for older Node.js versions.\n\nThis auto-discovery is only available for Node.jS versions prior to `v0.12`. Any newer versions will always default to the global `Promise` implementation.\n\n### Related\n\n- [any-observable](https://github.com/sindresorhus/any-observable) - `any-promise` for Observables.\n\n",
