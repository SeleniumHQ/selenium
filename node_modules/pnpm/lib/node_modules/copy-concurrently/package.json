  "readme": "# copy-concurrently\n\nCopy files, directories and symlinks\n\n```\nconst copy = require('copy-concurrently')\ncopy('/path/to/thing', '/new/path/thing').then(() => {\n  // this is now copied\n}).catch(err => {\n  // oh noooo\n})\n```\n\nCopies files, directories and symlinks.  Ownership is maintained when\nrunning as root, permissions are always maintained.  On Windows, if symlinks\nare unavailable then junctions will be used.\n\n## PUBLIC INTERFACE\n\n### copy(from, to, [options]) → Promise\n\nRecursively copies `from` to `to` and resolves its promise when finished. \nIf `to` already exists then the promise will be rejected with an `EEXIST`\nerror.\n\nOptions are:\n\n* maxConcurrency – (Default: `1`) The maximum number of concurrent copies to do at once.\n* recurseWith - (Default: `copy.item`) The function to call on each file after recursing into a directory.\n* isWindows - (Default: `process.platform === 'win32'`) If true enables Windows symlink semantics. This requires\n  an extra `stat` to determine if the destination of a symlink is a file or directory. If symlinking a directory\n  fails then we'll try making a junction instead.\n\nOptions can also include dependency injection:\n\n* Promise - (Default: `global.Promise`) The promise implementation to use, defaults to Node's.\n* fs - (Default: `require('fs')`) The filesystem module to use.  Can be used\n  to use `graceful-fs` or to inject a mock.\n* writeStreamAtomic - (Default: `require('fs-write-stream-atomic')`) The\n  implementation of `writeStreamAtomic` to use.  Used to inject a mock.\n* getuid - (Default: `process.getuid`) A function that returns the current UID. Used to inject a mock.\n\n## EXTENSION INTERFACE\n\nOrdinarily you'd only call `copy` above.  But it's possible to use it's\ncomponent functions directly.  This is useful if, say, you're writing\n[move-concurently](https://npmjs.com/package/move-concurrently).\n\n### copy.file(from, to, options) → Promise\n\nCopies an ordinary file `from` to destination `to`.  Uses\n`fs-write-stream-atomic` to ensure that the file is either entirely copied\nor not at all.\n\nOptions are:\n\n* uid, gid - (Optional) If `getuid()` is `0` then this and gid will be used to\n  set the user and group of `to`.  If uid is present then gid must be too.\n* mode - (Optional) If set then `to` will have its perms set to `mode`.\n* fs - (Default: `require('fs')`) The filesystem module to use.  Can be used\n  to use `graceful-fs` or to inject a mock.\n* Promise - (Default: `global.Promise`) The promise implementation to use, defaults to Node's.\n* writeStreamAtomic - (Default `require('fs-write-stream-atomic')`) The\n  implementation of `writeStreamAtomic` to use.  Used to inject a mock.\n\n### copy.symlink(from, to, options) → Promise\n\nCopies a symlink `from` to destination `to`.  If you're using Windows and\nsymlinking fails and what you're linking is a directory then junctions will\nbe tried instead.\n\nOptions are:\n\n* top - The top level the copy is being run from.  This is used to determine\n  if the symlink destination is within the set of files we're copying or\n  outside it.\n* fs - (Default: `require('fs')`) The filesystem module to use.  Can be used\n  to use `graceful-fs` or to inject a mock.\n* Promise - (Default: `global.Promise`) The promise implementation to use, defaults to Node's.\n* isWindows - (Default: `process.platform === 'win32'`) If true enables Windows symlink semantics. This requires\n  an extra `stat` to determine if the destination of a symlink is a file or directory. If symlinking a directory\n  fails then we'll try making a junction instead.\n\n### copy.recurse(from, to, options) → Promise\n\nReads all of the files in directory `from` and adds them to the `queue`\nusing `recurseWith` (by default `copy.item`).\n\nOptions are:\n\n* queue - A [`run-queue`](https://npmjs.com/package/run-queue) object to add files found inside `from` to.\n* recurseWith - (Default: `copy.item`) The function to call on each file after recursing into a directory.\n* uid, gid - (Optional) If `getuid()` is `0` then this and gid will be used to\n  set the user and group of `to`.  If uid is present then gid must be too.\n* mode - (Optional) If set then `to` will have its perms set to `mode`.\n* fs - (Default: `require('fs')`) The filesystem module to use.  Can be used\n  to use `graceful-fs` or to inject a mock.\n* getuid - (Default: `process.getuid`) A function that returns the current UID. Used to inject a mock.\n\n### copy.item(from, to, options) → Promise\n\nCopies some kind of `from` to destination `to`.  This looks at the filetype\nand calls `copy.file`, `copy.symlink` or `copy.recurse` as appropriate.\n\nSymlink copies are queued with a priority such that they happen after all\nfile and directory copies as you can't create a junction on windows to a\nfile that doesn't exist yet.\n\nOptions are:\n\n* top - The top level the copy is being run from.  This is used to determine\n  if the symlink destination is within the set of files we're copying or\n  outside it.\n* queue - The [`run-queue`](https://npmjs.com/package/run-queue) object to\n  pass to `copy.recurse` if `from` is a directory.\n* recurseWith - (Default: `copy.item`) The function to call on each file after recursing into a directory.\n* uid, gid - (Optional) If `getuid()` is `0` then this and gid will be used to\n  set the user and group of `to`.  If uid is present then gid must be too.\n* mode - (Optional) If set then `to` will have its perms set to `mode`.\n* fs - (Default: `require('fs')`) The filesystem module to use.  Can be used\n  to use `graceful-fs` or to inject a mock.\n* getuid - (Default: `process.getuid`) A function that returns the current UID. Used to inject a mock.\n* isWindows - (Default: `process.platform === 'win32'`) If true enables Windows symlink semantics. This requires\n  an extra `stat` to determine if the destination of a symlink is a file or directory. If symlinking a directory\n  fails then we'll try making a junction instead.\n* Promise - (Default: `global.Promise`) The promise implementation to use, defaults to Node's.\n* writeStreamAtomic - (Default `require('fs-write-stream-atomic')`) The\n  implementation of `writeStreamAtomic` to use.
