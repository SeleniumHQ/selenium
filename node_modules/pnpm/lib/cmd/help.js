        pnpm store add [pkg...]

        Adds new packages to the store. E.g.: pnpm store add express@4 typescript@2

        pnpm store prune

        Removes unreferenced (extraneous, orphan) packages from the store. Unreferenced packages are packages that are not used by
        any projects on the system. Packages can become unreferenced after most installation operations. For instance, package
        foo@1.0.0 is updated to foo@1.0.1. If package foo@1.0.0 is not used by any other project on the system, it becomes unreferenced.

        It is good to keep unreferenced packages in the store for a while because frequently unreferenced packages are again needed
        very soon. For instance, after changing branch on a project and installing from an older shrinkwrap file.

        Pruning the store makes no harm. It only makes installation a bit slower in case the unreferenced files will be needed again.

        Commands:

            Uninstall a dependency from each package

          link
            Deprecated. Use the install command with the link-workspace-packages config.
            runs installation in each package. If a package is available locally, the local version is linked.

          unlink
            Removes links to local packages and reinstalls them from the registry.

          list [[<@scope>/]<pkg>...]
            List dependencies in each package.

          outdated [[<@scope>/]<pkg>...]
            Check for outdated dependencies in every package.

          run <command> [-- <args>...]
            This runs an arbitrary command from each package's "scripts" object.
            If a package doesn't have the command, it is skipped.
            If none of the packages have the command, the command fails.

          test [-- <args>...]
            This runs each package's "test" script, if one was provided.

          rebuild [[<@scope>/<name>]...]
            This command runs the "npm build" command on each package.
            This is useful when you install a new version of node,
            and must recompile all your C++ addons with the new binary.

          exec -- <command> [args...]      run a command in each package.

        Options:

          -- <package selector>..., --filter <package selector>
            Run the command only on packages that satisfy at least one of the selectors.

            Example: pnpm recursive install -- foo... ...@bar/* qar ./components

            These selectors may be used:

            <pattern>
              Restricts the scope to package names matching the given pattern. E.g.: foo, @bar/*

            <pattern>...
              Includes all direct and indirect dependencies of the matched packages. E.g.: foo...

            ...<pattern>
              Includes all direct and indirect dependents of the matched packages. E.g.: ...foo, ...@bar/*

            ./<directory>
              Includes all packages that are inside a given subdirectory. E.g.: ./components

            .
              Includes all packages that are under the current working directory.

          --no-bail
            Continues executing other tasks even if a task threw an error.

          --workspace-concurrency <number>
            Set the maximum number of concurrency. Default is 4. For unlimited concurrency use Infinity.

          --link-workspace-packages
            Locally available packages are linked to node_modules instead of being downloaded from the registry.
            Convenient to use in a multi-package repository.

          --sort
            Sort packages topologically (dependencies before dependents). Pass --no-sort to disable.
